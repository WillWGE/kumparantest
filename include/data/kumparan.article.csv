4,asian stocks sink euro near nine year,"HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone, Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece´s exit almost inevitable if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be manageable, the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come, IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

13,oil market rebounds on iea repor,"London: World oil prices rebounded Friday after the International Energy Agency declared there were signs the tide will turn following recent multi-year lows.In early afternoon London deals, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in March rallied $1.41 to trade at $49.68 per barrel. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February gained $1.09 at $47.34.How low the market´s floor will be is anyone´s guess, the Paris-based IEA energy watchdog said in a monthly report published on Friday.A price recovery -- barring any major disruption -- may not be imminent, but signs are mounting that the tide will turn.Crude futures have more than halved since June, crashing on stubborn worries over global oversupply and weak demand in a faltering world economy.The IEA cautioned Friday that prices were expected to keep falling in the short-term.The IEA have hedged their bets somewhat by saying the tide may turn, noted CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.He added that the market is very oversold and was probably due a rebound.European benchmark Brent had tumbled Tuesday to $45.19 per barrel, hitting the lowest level since March 2009.The IEA added Friday that the dramatic collapse in oil prices was still insufficient to stimulate crude consumption, because weakness in the economy has cancelled out the benefits of cheaper crude.The agency maintained its oil demand forecast for 2015, expecting it to grow by 0.9 million barrels a day to reach 93.3 million barrels.The oil market rebounded Friday after plunging the previous day on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had overproduced in December, while it also cut its global demand outlook.The 12-nation OPEC cartel, which produces about one third of global supplies, said in a monthly report Thursday that its production rose to 30.2 million barrels a day in December, above its 30 million limit.It also projected that demand for its oil would fall to 28.8 million barrels per day this year from 29.1 million in 2014.The yo-yo effect of the crude oil prices can be attributed to the uncertainty in the market, said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts, pointing to an unstable dollar and an irregular equity market.OPEC has just forecasted a drop in demand for its oil this year and this could mean that the price rally we saw this week is unlikely to last, she said.Despite the global supply glut, OPEC decided in November to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels of oil per day.Cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia has stated that OPEC will not cut production even if the price drops to $20 per barrel, in a move aimed at hurting US shale oil producers.

21,euro maintains gains asia stocks adv,"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market, Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode.The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen. It bought 133.31 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.The dollar edged up to 118.47 yen from 118.49 yen in US trade.Oil prices edged up slightly after falling to fresh six-year lows Monday, despite a warning from the OPEC cartel that prices could punch $200 owing to shrinking investment in exploration.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose five cents to $45.20 while Brent crude for March gained 13 cents to $48.29.Gold fetched $1,276.39 an ounce, against $1,281.39 late Monday.

22,oil rebounds sharply from six year lows as dollar,"New York: Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from six-year lows as the dollar weakened after disappointing US economic data.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, rose $1.08 (2.4 percent) to close at $45.16 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for March settled at $49.60 a barrel in London, up $1.44 from Monday´s closing level.The market has found a bottom in the mid-40 range, said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors.Crude futures sank Monday to their lowest closing levels since early 2009. Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.I didn´t see anything bullish today for WTI, he said. Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.It´s too low for everybody, said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world´s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

27,oil prices slide after rally,"London: Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, said the crude market was extremely volatile after the three-day rally that began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent.It has become increasingly difficult to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain unchanged, Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10 in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

83,dollar pressured after fed tempers interest rate,"Tokyo: The dollar struggled to recover Thursday after diving on comments from the US Federal Reserve that cooled expectations of an early summer interest rate hike.In Tokyo, the greenback briefly fell below 120 yen before ticking up to 120.22 yen by midday, well down from 121.35 yen level in Tokyo before the US central bank´s announcement. The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen, down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.It´s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates ´lift-off´ will begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, National Australia Bank said.The key takeaway is that (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market´s mind the data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain patient on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn´t mean we´re going to be impatient, Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed´s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen´s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank´s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere, he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.

95,Oil ends 2015 down 35 per,"NEW YORK/LONDON: Oil prices rose on Thursday but fell as much as 35 percent for the year after a race to pump by Middle East crude producers and U.S. shale oil drillers created an unprecedented global glut that may take through 2016 to clear.Global oil benchmark Brent and U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose between 1 and 2 percent on the day on short-covering and buying support in a thinly traded market ahead of the New Year holiday.But for 2015, both benchmarks fell double-digits for a second straight year as Saudi Arabia and other members of the once-powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) again failed to boost oil prices.The U.S. shale industry, meanwhile, surprised the world again with its ability to survive rock-bottom crude prices, churning out more supply than expected, even as the sell-off in oil slashed by two-thirds the number of drilling rigs in the country from a year ago.The United States also took a historic move in repealing a 40-year ban on U.S. crude exports to countries outside Canada, acknowledging the industry's growth.You do have to tip your hat to the U.S. shale industry and their ongoing ability to drive down costs and hang in there, albeit by their fingernails, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, an energy hedge fund in New York.Brent crude settled up 82 cents at $37.28 a barrel, rebounding from a near 11-year low of $36.10 hit earlier in the session. For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Niño weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.We have brimming oil inventories in Europe, Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks, it said.INDUSTRY PAINBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.",1/1/2016,95,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
119,Modi launches 15 bln fund to support start u,"NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a number of initiatives on Saturday to support the country´s start-ups, including a 100 billion rupee ($1.5 billion) fund and a string of tax breaks for both the companies and their investors.India, which already has a handful of new generation success stories, is seeking to encourage more cutting edge technology and other start-ups - supporting new businesses in a country which badly needs to accelerate a still sluggish economic recovery and create millions of jobs as the workforce expands.Modi´s high-profile event in New Delhi - attended by hundreds of investors and entrepreneurs, including the founder of taxi-hailing app Uber, Travis Kalanick - promised a shot in the arm for the sector, with exemptions from tax and compliance inspections for three years.I urge all entrepreneurs to create companies that solve India´s problems and create jobs, he told a packed auditorium in New Delhi, speaking in Hindi.Start-up does not mean a billion dollar company where thousands of people work. It is about employing even 5 people, and developing India.Online companies such as e-commerce marketplaces Flipkart and Snapdeal, along with ride-sharing company Ola, have highlighted the potential for home-grown technology successes in a country best known for capitalising on cheap engineering talent as the world´s back office.However, the push by Modi´s government is the first time Indian policymakers have announced an agenda directly aimed at promoting start-ups and entrepreneurship.Modi unveiled plans for a new 100 billion rupee fund: a structured fund of funds that will invest in venture capital funds over a period of four years, financed by the government and the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).He also said start-up companies would benefit from cheaper and faster patent applications, enjoying 80 percent rebates on the cost of patents.A mobile app would allow companies to be set up within a day, he promised.Moreover, they will be exempt from income tax for the first three years in which they make a profit.Their investors could also benefit: recognised funds of funds could see exemptions<br/>from capital gains tax, Modi said.The announcements, at a government-organised conference on start-ups in New Delhi, come months after Modi made a whirlwind tour of Silicon Valley, meeting the chief executives of Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Apple Inc.India, with a rapidly expanding population of Internet users, is seen as one of the world´s fastest growing start-up hotspots.Venture capital funds including Sequoia and Tiger Global have raised multi-billion dollar funds for their Indian investments in recent years.The National Association of Software and Services Companies estimates the number of new companies launched in India grew by 40 percent in the last year.Earlier on Saturday, Japan´s Softbank said it would seriously accelerate investments in India, comparing the growth in India´s internet economy to China a decade ago.Softbank had previously said it would invest $10 billion in India over 10 years.WeWork, a New York-based provider of shared office space, used the conference to announce its Indian launch plans.",1/16/2016,119,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
124,Oil slides to lowest since 2003 as Iran sanctions are lifted,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices hit their lowest since 2003 on Monday, as the market braced for a jump in Iranian exports after the lifting of sanctions against the country at the weekend.The UN nuclear watchdog on Saturday said Tehran had met its commitments to curtail its nuclear programme, and the United States immediately revoked sanctions that had slashed the OPEC member's oil exports by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak to little more than 1 million bpd.Iran is now free to sell as much oil as it wants to whomever it likes at whatever price it can get, said Richard Nephew, program director for Economic Statecraft, Sanctions and Energy Markets at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Iran is ready to increase its crude exports by 500,000 bpd, its deputy oil minister said on Sunday.In what traders described as a knee-jerk reaction, international Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003, before recovering to $28.56 by 0208 GMT, still down over 1 percent from its settlement on Friday.US crude was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, after hitting a 2003-low of $28.36 earlier in the session.The lifting of sanctions on Iran should see further downward pressure on oil ... in the short term, ANZ said on Monday.Iran's likely strategy in offering discounts to entice customers could see further downward pressure on prices in the near term, the bank added.Trading data shows that short positions in US crude markets, which would profit from further price falls, have hit a fresh record despite steep recent drops.While this could trigger sudden price jumps once traders close positions to cash in from further drops, it also indicates that many market participants think there is still more downside to prices.Iran's potential new exports come at a time when global markets are already reeling from chronic oversupply as producers pump a million barrels or more of crude every day in excess of demand, pulling down crude prices by over 75 percent since mid-2014 and by over a quarter since the start of 2016.And although analysts expect Iran to take some time before being able to fully revive its export infrastructure, suffering from years of underinvestment during the sanctions, it does have at least a dozen Very Large Crude Carrier super-tankers filled and in place to sell into the market.The oil price rout is also hurting stock markets, with Asian shares set to slide to near their 2011 troughs on Monday, stoking further worries about a global economic downturn.Growth keeps slowing ... Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining capex and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia, said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong.",1/18/2016,124,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
125,Asia stocks up modestly as China GDP figures match expectati,"Tokyo: Asian stocks rose modestly and crude oil prices nudged up on Tuesday after Chinese GDP figures were mostly in line with expectations.China's economy grew 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the data showed, the slowest growth since 2009. Industrial output in December rose 5.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with forecasts for a 6.0 percent increase.The lack of negative surprises offered the market a slight reprieve following a tumultuous start to 2016 as concerns about China's economic health weighed heavily on global growth prospects.I think that at least the biggest fears about the real economy, fears that came to the surface during the stock market rout...I think those biggest fears were overblown, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.We don't see signs of an abrupt slowdown, or something getting worse than we had expected say six weeks ago.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent after earlier touching its lowest level since October 2011.Australian shares added 0.8 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei dropped 0.3 percent.Volatile Shanghai shares rose 0.2 percent, to pull away from a 13-month low on Monday.In commodities, Brent crude was up 0.9 percent at $28.81 a barrel, pulling away from a 13-year low of $27.67 hit on Monday on worries about the return of additional Iranian crude to an already oversupplied market.International sanctions on Tehran were lifted over the weekend, removing an obstacle to one of the world's biggest oil producing nations.U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day.The Australian dollar, often used as a proxy for China-related trades, stood little changed at $0.6859. The Aussie fell to a seven-year low of $0.6827 last week amid a rout in commodity-linked currencies.The dollar nudged up 0.2 percent to 117.55 yen after slipping last week to a 4-1/2-month low of 116.51.The euro was flat at $1.0894 after dipping about 0.2 percent on Monday.",1/19/2016,125,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

138,Asia stocks edge up after Japan policy boost debt shi,"HONG KONG: Asian stocks started a new month on a cautious note on Monday, with the Bank of Japan's surprise policy easing sparking some buying but further signs of economic weakness in China and a fall in oil prices keeping investors on guard.The greenback continued to benefit from the growing monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and its counterparts in Europe and Asia while bonds, especially investment grade debt, received a boost after Japan's surprise decision to introduce negative interest rates last week.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent, after losing 8 percent in January.Australia and Japan leading regional markets with gains of more than 1 percent each, while Chinese stocks slipped in early trade.In the short term, the surprise move by Japan will be a catalyst for global equities but it only underlines the weakness of the global economy and we need to see some strong economics data for a sustainable rally, said Cliff Tan, head of global markets research with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.Monday's batch of economic data from China added to worries about the health of the world's second-largest economy and only increased calls for more policy easing from China.Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace in almost three-and-a-half years in January, missing market expectations, while growth in the services sector slowed, official surveys showed on Monday.As deflationary pressures remain high, further reserve requirement cuts are still needed to support the slowing economy and permanently inject liquidity into the market, ANZ strategists wrote in a note. They expect a total of 200 basis points of cuts this year with a 50 basis points cut coming in the first quarter.In fact, refraining from further easing could risk an even weaker economy, which will then intensify depreciation expectation and capital outflows.The Shanghai Composite Index eased 0.8 percent in early trade, while the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 0.6 percent. January was the worst monthly performance for the Shanghai market since the 2008 crisis with more than a 10 percent loss.The Bank of Japan said it would charge for a portion of bank reserves parked with the institution, an aggressive policy pioneered by the European Central Bank (ECB). Earlier in January, the ECB indicated it could cut rates further in March.The fact that both the BOJ and the ECB suddenly showed additional easing stance after the markets' rout suggests policymakers in Japan and Europe share concerns and take actions, Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, said.In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve has so far stuck to the script that it will gradually raise interest rates this year even though bets have been pared back with Federal Fund rate futures pricing in barely one hike this year.Elsewhere, fixed income markets cheered a fresh round of policy easing from a major global central bank with investment grade debt in Asia ending a torrid January on a high note.In government debt, the rate-sensitive U.S. two-year yield fell to a three-month low of 0.766 percent on Friday before bouncing somewhat to 0.779 percent.The U.S. 10-year debt yield fell to 1.93 percent, edging near a double-bottom around 1.90 percent made in August-October, also helped by speculation Japanese investors will go after U.S. bonds as local bond yields plunge.On Monday the 10-year Japanese government bond yield hit a record low of 0.050 percent while the two-year yield hit a record minus 0.100 percent.Negative interest rates pressured the yen, which traded briefly at 121.38 to the dollar, near six-week low of 121.70 touched on Friday.The euro was steadier at $1.08440.Oil prices fell, with international benchmark Brent sliding 1.8 percent to $35.35 per barrel.Still, oil has bounced more than 30 percent from a 12-year low hit less than two weeks ago, taking some pressure off reeling global equity markets but that bounce is proving to be fleeting.A 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index, a global benchmark for commodities edged higher and up more than 8 percent from a 13-year low hit in late January.",2/1/2016,138,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
143,WB president for Pakistan to invest in people to boost economy,"ISLAMABAD: World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim on Tuesday underlined the need for investing in people to make Pakistan a successful economy of the world.“Providing best education and health care facilities to the people would help them offer good performance in every field of life for the economic growth of the country,” he said while addressing a meeting held here on Tuesday.Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar Minister for Planning Development and Reforms Ahsan Iqbal federal ministers and other senior officials of the government attended the meeting.He quoted from sayings of founder of the nation Quid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah of ‘Unity, Faith and Discipline’ and self devotion to duties, adding that if these principles were followed Pakistan could become next great success story.The WB President said Pakistan was passing through a critical phase of development and the government could play a historical role in the development of the economy during next two years.He stressed the need for investing in people specially in early childhood education and provision of health facilities to further boost economic growth in the country.He said private sector of any country could play vital role in the economic development and Pakistan should also strengthen its private sector by providing incentives to the sector.Kim said Pakistan was now on the right track and it could become the next great success story of the world.He said the World Bank was ready to offer its experience to Pakistan for making a sustainable growth.He said every country needed to take tough decisions and undertake structural reforms to consolidate its economy. Pakistan should do the same, he added.Due to good policies of the government, Pakistan has survived from being bankrupt, he remarked.Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar in his welcome remarks said due to prudent reform initiatives of the government the tax to GDP ratio had risen from 8.5 percent to 10 percent while the revenues had registered 18.2 percent growth.“We are on the track and economic indicators are showing improvement,” he added.Ishaq Dar further said that GDP growth in fiscal year was 4.24 percent which was the highest in seven years and it would be further increased to 5 percent in current financial year.Fiscal deficit he said would be brought down to 4.3percent in the current fiscal year.He also informed that for Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) allocations had been increased three times.Dar said previous governments did not give proper attention on energy generation which created energy crisis in the country.He added the government had initiated a number of energy projects and by 2018 10 000 MW more electricity would be added in the system.Ahsan Iqbal on the occasion highlighted the government’s vision 2025 initiated for the benefit of the country and its people.He said that China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) had been initiated at a cost of US 46 billion which would be a game change not only for Pakistan but the entire region.",2/9/2016,143,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
146,IEA sees global oil glut worsening OPEC deal unlikely,"LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.The agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low, the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go, the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.”",2/9/2016,146,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
161,Asian shares extend gains as investor fears,"TOKYO: Asian shares extended their gains on Tuesday as a combination of stabilising Chinese markets, a rebound in oil prices and solid US consumption data drove investors to look for bargains after last week's rout.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.6 percent, with Chinese bank shares leading the gains after a surprise jump in China's bank lending data.Mainland Chinese shares also rose 2.5 percent to three-week highs.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.9 percent after a 7.2 percent climb on Monday, recovering a sizable part of its 11 percent slump last week - its biggest since 2008.On Monday, European stocks rose 2.9 percent, having shed nearly 10 percent over the last two weeks. U.S. financial markets were closed for a national holiday but globally-traded U.S. stock futures rose 1.5 percent.It is partly a reaction after such big falls last week. Solid U.S. data is also improving investor sentiment given that they are counting on U.S. growth to lead the global economy, said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.U.S. retail sales data published on Friday showing firm growth allayed fears - at least for now - that the U.S. economy could be dragged into recession as growth stumbles in many parts of the world.Sentiment on the U.S. currency also improved, with the dollar rising to 114.65 yen, recovering further from a 15-month low of 110.985 touched on Thursday.The euro also eased to as low as $1.1128 on Monday, retreating from Thursday's 3 1/2-month high of $1.1377, and last stood at $1.1173.The common currency was also driven lower by remarks from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank is ready to ease policy further in March.Gold extended fall from Thursday's one-year peak of $1,262.90 per ounce as safe-haven buying in the precious metal in recent weeks was rolled back.It fell 0.6 percent to $1,203.90, unable to find a floor after 2.2 percent on Monday, which was its biggest fall in almost seven months.Oil prices gained on news of a rare private meeting of top officials from the world's biggest oil producers spurred speculation of an eventual deal to tackle a deep supply glut.Global benchmark Brent futures rose 3.3 percent to $34.48 a barrel, rising to their highest level in a week. U.S. crude futures also jumped back above $30.As risk sentiment improved, yields on top-rated government bond rose, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rising 4.7 basis points to 1.793 percent from 1.746 percent at the end of last week.The Bank of Japan started implementing negative interest rates on Tuesday. The benchmark interbank lending rate fell to zero percent but not to negative levels partly because some banks have not fixed their system to deal with negative rates.",2/16/2016,161,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
164,Oil up 7 percent as Iran welcomes output freez,"NEW YORK/LONDON: Oil prices rose 7 percent on Wednesday after Iran voiced support for a Russia-Saudi-led move to freeze production to deal with the market glut that had pressured crude prices to their lowest in a dozen years.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh met counterparts from Venezuela, Iraq and Qatar in Tehran for over two hours on Wednesday, saying the proposed production ceiling should be the first step toward stabilizing the market.Zanganeh, quoted by Tehran's Shana news agency, did not say explicitly say that Iran will keep its own output at January's levels, in line with the proposal that major producers including Russia and Saudi Arabia restrict output.An Iranian official, speaking before Wednesday's meeting, said Iran would continue increasing its oil output to levels held before the 2012 trade sanctions imposed on the fourth largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Tehran has been the main obstacle to the first joint OPEC and non-OPEC deal in 15 years, after its pledge to recapture market share lost to sanctions.Even so, Zanganeh's endorsement of the production freeze plan helped spark a powerful rally.Brent settled up $2.32, or 7.2 percent, at $34.50 a barrel.U.S. crude closed up $1.62, or 5.6 percent, at $30.66 a barrel.Prices extended gains in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed a stockpile drop of 3.3 million barrels versus analysts' forecasts for a build of 3.9 million barrels. The U.S. government will release official stockpile data on Thursday.Options expiry in U.S. crude also fed Wednesday's rebound, some traders said.Some investors said they had a better outlook for oil now.I'm pricing between $35 and $45 for Brent by summer, as we still have a daily surplus of up to 1.7 million barrels of oil to contend with, said Phil Davis, an independent crude trader at PSW Investments.Others were more skeptical. I think people will be in a wait-and-see mode, said Scott Shelton, energy broker for ICAP. Risk would be lower because of the volatility involved.Traded volume in U.S. crude futures was just above 500 million barrels, lower than the past three sessions, Reuters data showed, despite the price gains and activity prior to options expiry.",2/18/2016,164,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
168,Asia shares edge ahead with oil pound sli,"SYDNEY: Asian share markets edged cautiously higher on Monday as investors awaited a rush of February industry surveys to take the pulse of the global economy, while sterling suffered on concerns the UK might yet vote to leave the European Union.A busy week for data culminates with a Group of 20 meeting that offers leaders a chance to soothe market concerns with talk of coordination, even if it produces nothing concrete.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.7 percent, having rebounded more than 4 percent last week.E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 ESc1 were also up 0.3 percent.The calmer mood was aided by oil as Brent crude added 31 cents to $33.32 and US crude rose 26 cents to $29.90.Japan's Nikkei recouped early losses to rise 0.7 percent, buoyed by a retreat in the yen even as an activity survey showed a drop in new export orders took a heavy toll on manufacturing.The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan fell to 50.2 in February, from 52.3 in January, a potentially bleak omen for the rest of the region.China's major stock indexes firmed as investors welcomed news over the weekend that the head securities regulator was being replaced.The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both rose 0.9 percent.While Wall Street ended Friday with a whimper, the major indexes still boasted their best weekly performances this year, with the Nasdaq tallying its strongest week since July.Equity markets successfully stress-tested and bounced from key technical support last week, wrote analysts at RBC Capital Markets.While we cannot definitively say the cycle/2016 lows are in place yet, the technical evidence continues to suggest a more durable bottom may be forming.TO LEAVE, OR NOTThe early price activity was in sterling, which beat a hasty retreat as worries that Britain may quit the European Union flared up after London Mayor Boris Johnson threw his weight behind the exit campaign.The pound fell around 1 percent on the greenback, euro and yen. It slid as far as $1.4235 and 160.07 yen, from around $1.4405 and 162.10 late on Friday.Sterling has just about completely reversed gains made on Friday after EU leaders agreed unanimously on a package of measures aimed at keeping Britain in the 28-nation bloc to avoid a potentially disastrous divorce.The other major currencies were steadier. The dollar was a touch firmer at 112.89 yen, as was the euro at 125.45. Against the greenback, the common currency was also slightly weaker at $1.1116.The dollar was underpinned by data last Friday that showed underlying US consumer price inflation accelerated in January by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years.The figures should support the view that the Fed could gradually raise interest rates this year as forecast, though markets remained highly skeptical given the backdrop of slowing global growth and market turbulence.Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 rich nations gather in Shanghai this week to discuss those global headwinds.There has been some chatter about a possible grand currency agreement that would allow for a depreciation in the US dollar, which might relieve pressure on commodity prices and on emerging markets.However, most analysts consider it very unlikely given so many of the G20 central banks are actively easing policy and need their own currencies to stay competitive.",2/22/2016,168,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
171,Asian shares oil retreat as Saudi plays down output cu,"TOKYO/SINGAPORE: Asian shares fell on Wednesday as oil prices skidded after Saudi Arabia effectively ruled out production cuts by major producers anytime soon, sending investors into safe-havens such as the yen.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended earlier losses to fall 1.1 percent as of 0246 GMT, slipping further from Monday's six-week high.Japan's Nikkei shed 0.7 percent on the drop in oil prices and as the stronger yen weighed on exporters.Chinese shares opened higher but surrendered the gains, with the CSI 300 index down 0.1 percent and the Shanghai Composite little changed.The US S&amp;P 500 Index fell 1.25 percent on Tuesday to 1,921.27, having failed to rise above its peak hit on Feb. 1, with energy and material sectors being a major drag as oil prices quickly gave up Monday's hefty gains.Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi told oil executives on Tuesday that markets should not view the agreement by four major oil producers to freeze output at January levels as a prelude to production cuts.While Naimi said he was confident more nations would join the pact, Iran was seen as unlikely to agree to the output cap, which does not allow Iran to regain the market share it lost during sanctions.Oil prices slid in early Asia trade, extending losses of more than 5 percent overnight. US crude futures were down 1.8 percent at $31.29 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent futures were down 1 percent at $32.94.I suspect few people were expecting a deal to cut production so his comments are hardly a surprise. Yet, the latest development seems to suggest that for oil producers to get more united they will have to feel more pain, said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.The toll from low oil prices is also spreading to banks that have exposure to the energy sector, as roughly a third of US shale oil producers are at high risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte.JP Morgan, the largest US bank by assets, said it will increase provisions for expected losses on energy loans by $500 million, or more than 60 percent of its existing reserves.JPMorgan shares fell 4.2 percent on the announcement.Investors instead favoured safer assets such as US Treasuries, with the 10-year notes yield falling to a two-week low of 1.714 percent overnight.The increased risk aversion led gold to erase all its losses from earlier this week to trade at $1,227.30 per ounce, coming near its one-year high of $1,262.90 touched about two weeks ago.In the currency market, traditional safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc outperformed.The yen firmed to 111.77 to the dollar on Tuesday, edging near its 15-month high of 110.985 hit on Feb. 11. It last stood at 111.90.The Swiss franc gained broadly, hitting a one-month high on the euro at 1.09165 franc per euro on Tuesday. It has since weakened to 1.0929 franc per euro.The franc got a lift also as the head of its central bank warned it could not endlessly take further steps to ease monetary conditions.The euro in contrast was hit by a key index on German business climate showing sentiment among German manufacturers plunged by its largest amount since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Against the dollar, the euro fell to three-week low of $1.0990 on Tuesday and last stood at $1.10160.The British pound remained on defensive, hitting a seven-year low below $1.40 in early Asian trade on Wednesday on worries Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum.",2/24/2016,171,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

That helped offset investors' fears about record high crude inventories.The sharp downturn in global oil prices has fed investor fears about slowing world growth, with broader concerns about China's cooling economy adding to heightened anxiety and financial market volatility.Brent crude for April delivery skidded 1.1 percent to $34.04 a barrel.Wednesday's recovery in crude oil prices helped drag Wall Street higher at the close, after lackluster economic data weighed on sentiment for much of the session.US data showed the services sector contracted in early February for the first time since October 2013, suggesting a weakening of economic conditions beyond the troubled manufacturing and energy industries. Other data showed weakness in new US single-family home sales, though the overall housing market recovery remains intact.Spot gold erased early losses and rose about 0.4 percent to $1,234.50 an ounce, within site of a one-year high of $1,260.60 reached on Feb. 11.",2/25/2016,172,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

178,Asian shares slip after G20 Fed ang,"TOKYO: Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it, Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it, he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to consult closely on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rateThe US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda, said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of Brexit offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against Brexit in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.",2/29/2016,178,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

191,Gold hits 13 month top on firm eur,"MANILA: Gold climbed to a 13-month high on Friday, buoyed by gains in the euro after the European Central Bank (ECB) signalled it was done cutting interest rates for now.The ECB on Thursday rolled out measures, including an expansion in asset buying and a deeper cut to deposit rates.But the euro hit a three-week top, and held near that level on Friday, after ECB President Mario Draghi signalled there would be no further rate cuts.Spot gold rose as far as $1,282.51 an ounce, its strongest since Feb. 3, 2015, and was trading at $1,277.20 by 0237 GMT, up 0.5 percent.Bullion climbed 1.5 percent on Thursday, its biggest single-day gain in a week, and was on course for a second weekly rise.For the year, gold has added more than 20 percent.US gold for April delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $1,277.60 an ounce, after peaking at $1,287.80.The next major resistance level for gold would be around $1,308, reached in January last year, said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.Ultimately if this trend continues, we may well see ourselves up towards $1,400 in gold, he said.The relatively weak US dollar, despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year, as well as concerns about a wobbly global economy should support gold prices going forward, said Spooner.Gold remains our preferred commodity/sector in view of increasing liquidity from global monetary easing, Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau wrote in a research note.Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world´s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 25.68 million ounces on Thursday, the highest since August 2014.With the metal clinging to this year´s gains, physical gold demand slowed in top consumer China this week, while a strike by jewellers protesting against the imposition of a tax curbed demand in No.2 market India.Spot silver gained 0.4 percent to $15.65 an ounce, platinum advanced 0.8 percent to $983.35 and palladium was steady at $570.",3/11/2016,191,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
201,IMF urges key G20 countries spend gr,"CHENGDU, China: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned risks to the global economy are growing, as it called on some G20 nations to boost government spending.Central bank chiefs and finance ministers from the world´s top 20 economies gathered in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday to tackle a slowing global economy facing new uncertainties with Britain voting to leave the European Union (EU).Global growth remains weak, and downside risks have become more salient, the IMF said in a report released ahead of the G20 meeting.Growth could be even lower if the current increases in economic and political uncertainty in the wake of the ´Brexit´ vote continue.In an update to its April forecast, the IMF lowered its forecasts for global growth this year and next by 0.1 percent, to 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.Britain´s new finance minister Philip Hammond is among those attending to deliver a message that his country is still open for business, according to a statement from the British treasury.The IMF wants advanced economies like Germany and the United States to channel more public spending into infrastructure investment to help boost global growth, an issue that has sparked divisions among G20 members.Reforms that facilitate the scaling up of infrastructure investment would help raise productive capacity, boost short-term demand directly, and catalyse private investment, it said.- Terrorism, Turkey, Trump -But other challenges loom besides Brexit, including what one official attending referred to as the Three Ts -- terrorism, Turkey and Trump.The recent attack in the French city of Nice which killed 84 people, the third major incident in the European country over the past 18 months, has rattled financial markets, and a gunman in the German city of Munich killed nine people on Friday.A failed coup in Turkey which had aimed at unseating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his huge subsequent crackdown on opponents, has alarmed Ankara´s Western allies.Speaking at a G20-linked tax seminar on Saturday, Turkey´s Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek sought to reassure other countries.Despite what has happened a week ago in Turkey... we will continue to strongly adhere to democratic principles and apply rule of law, and not much really has changed, he said.Tycoon Donald Trump sealing the Republican party nomination in the US presidential race, where he will face Democrat Hillary Clinton, could add uncertainty if the contest is close.At an earlier G20 meeting in February, finance ministers vowed to use all policy tools -- monetary, fiscal and structural -- to support economic growth.The G20 process has given us greater ability to focus globally on how to use the different tools at our disposal to promote growth, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told the tax seminar.But with the use of monetary policy reaching its limits in some countries, analysts see more room for using fiscal measures.As to stimulus, we actually do not expect much monetary stimulus ahead in the major advanced economies other than in Japan, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, told AFP ahead of the G20 meeting.But I do think that the likelihood of fiscal policy easing is rising globally.",7/23/2016,201,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

225,Fast beauty Korean cosmetics shine China draw investor,"SEOUL: At an Innisfree cosmetics store in Seoul's popular Myeongdong shopping district, a saleswoman helps 21-year-old Chinese tourist Yang Hui carry her shopping baskets to the pay desk in front of a large display showing K-Pop star Yoona</.There's a lot to choose from, said Yang, confessing to having bought more than she'd planned from the store's range of around 900 products.South Korea's top cosmetics company Amorepacific Group (002790.KS) launches some 400 new Innisfree branded products a year, about half of which are no longer available a year later.It's one of dozens of Korean mass cosmetics brands with a short product development cycle - a fast beauty approach that is increasingly popular among Chinese and other Asian millennials, gaining exposure in the United States and Europe, and attracting high-profile foreign investment.South Korea has become a hot-bed for applying to cosmetics the fast fashion principles of shifting designs quickly from catwalk to Main Street to capitalise on new trends.Thousands of small cosmetics firms compete to get their new products to market, with third-party manufacturers cutting the time on testing and recipe alignment and providing the capacity for swift market launch.Korean brands have cut product development cycles to as little as four months, compared to over a year for global brands, industry experts say.When we received an eyeshadow order from a major global client in 2004, it took us two years to begin production. Now it takes us one year from the word go, said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average, Lim added.WINNING FORMULASouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly, said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products BB cream and CC cream, South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.Korean consumers are very sophisticated. Their interest in beauty and expectations of cosmetics are high and they are willing to try new concepts, L'Oreal Korea said in emailed comments to Reuters. It's a market where new trends emerge before potentially going global.CHINA FOUNDATIONFor foreign investors, buying into the Korean success story is a convenient way also into China, where locals can't get enough of Korean TV dramas and K-Pop music.We find beauty and media-entertainment sectors to be the most exciting (in Korea), said Ravi Thakran, the chairman and managing partner at L Capital Asia, a unit of LVMH (LVMH.PA), which last month became a major shareholder in South Korean colour cosmetics brand CLIO. The popularity of Korean culture such as K-Pop, dramas and celebrities boosted significant demand for Korean beauty products in China and other Southeast Asian countries, he added.Beyond China, Korean cosmetics have also moved into chains including LVMH's Sephora, Target (TGT.N) and Urban Outfitters (URBN.O), according to Korea's state-run trade agency KOTRA.The LVMH unit's investment in CLIO came just weeks after Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Bain Capital Private Equity said they were buying a majority stake in unlisted cosmetics maker Carver Korea Co Ltd.($1 = 1,107.9000 won)",8/4/2016,225,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

346,Platini withdraws candidacy for FIFA presidency,"ZURICH: Banned European soccer boss Michel Platini has withdrawn his candidacy from the race for the presidency of soccer's scandal-plagued governing body FIFA, he told French sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday.Platini, the head of European soccer body UEFA, was handed an eight-year ban from the game along with outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter by the federation's independent Ethics Committee on Dec. 21.Both have been engulfed by the worst corruption scandal in FIFA's history as the sport faces criminal investigations in Switzerland and the United States, where 41 soccer officials and sports entities have been indicted on corruption-related charges.Former French international Platini has insisted he has done nothing wrong and was still hoping to win an appeal in time to have been allowed back in time for the election on Feb. 26., but said he had changed his mind.I withdraw my candidacy. I can no longer (go through with it). I have neither the time, nor the means to go and see the voters, to meet people, and to fight with others, he said in an interview which L'Equipe published on its website.By withdrawing, I chose to fully focus on my defence on a case where there's no talk of corruption, falsification anymore, in which there's nothing left.It's a matter of schedule, but it's not just that. How do you win an election when you're prevented from campaigning?Blatter and Platini were both banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) made to the Frenchman by FIFA with Blatter's approval in 2011 for work done a decade earlier.The committee said the payment, made at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election, lacked transparency and presented conflicts of interest, though both men denied wrongdoing.Platini had initially been seen as the favourite to replace Blatter in the Feb. 26 election where each of 209 national football associations who are members of FIFA hold one vote.I had... about hundred of official letters of support from federations and about 50 pledges, in two days, Platini said.Five candidates, none of them clear favourites, will take part in the election and a chance for the job of rebuilding the sport's beleaguered governing body.They are Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne of France, UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino of Switzerland and South Africa businessman Tokyo Sexwale.Infantino has been Platini's right-hand man at UEFA and announced his candidacy after the Frenchman had been initially suspended in October.Champagne, although a compatriot of Platini, is known to be a critic, has no connections with UEFA and says that FIFA's priority must be to spread the game's riches more evenly around the world.",1/8/2016,346,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

249,Ever wanted track where fish comes from Now you,"ROME: Anyone with internet access and a passion for seafood will soon be able to track commercial fishing trawlers all over the world, with a new tool that its developers hope will help end the overfishing that has decimated the world's fish stocks.Millions of people depend on fish to survive, and fish will be vital to feeding the world's growing population that is predicted to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, the United Nations says.But overfishing has diminished fish stocks, and illicit fishing is threatening people's access to food in many poor countries, according to the United Nations.We currently have around 450 million people globally who get their primary source of food from the ocean. This is 450 million meals a day under threat, said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans, Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing, said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally, he said.We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",8/18/2016,249,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
255,New York global property crown London Brexit fear,"NEW YORK: New York has knocked off London as the world's premier city for foreign investment in commercial real estate due to fears the vote to leave the European Union would diminish the British capital's appeal as a global financial center.Data on cross-border property transactions indicate greater unease among investors prior to the referendum, which voters unexpectedly approved on June 23, than had been captured in the capital markets prior to the vote.Cross-border capital flows into London real estate fell 44 percent in this year's first six months from the same period in 2015, according to data from brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.Property investors feared Britain's exit from the EU would erode London's role as a premier financial center and reduce the value of their investments, the majority of which are office buildings.Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of Britain's largest foreign investors, said on Wednesday it cut the value of its UK property portfolio by 5 percent because of the vote.It would be fair to say that London bore the brunt of Brexit fears, David Green-Morgan, director of global capital markets research for JLL in Chicago, said in an interview. The big fear is that London will lose a lot of the financial service jobs that has made it such a global financial center.New York gained $10.3 billion in cross-border investments in the first six months of the year compared with the $6.9 billion that London took in, data from JLL show. In the same year-ago period, London garnered $12.4 billion while $11.3 billion flowed to New York, according to JLL.The 8.9 percent decline in cross-border investment New York experienced is in-line with the roughly 10 percent decline major cities experienced this year when compared to 2015, a stellar year in property investment around the world.Concerns the UK market was coming toward the end of the cycle amid signs pricing was reaching unsustainable levels only partially explains the drop-off in investment flows to Britain, the largest decline since the financial crisis.It is now obvious that people were becoming increasingly nervous about the Brexit vote, Green-Morgan said.Britain is viewed as more investor friendly than the United States because of beneficial tax arrangements. However, underlying property fundamentals - strong demand and not too much supply - must be in place to attract capital, as now is the case for the U.S. office and multifamily real estate sectors.The uncertainties created by Brexit has made investors more cautious about Britain and to a lesser extent about Europe, said Ken McCarthy, senior managing director, regional research director for Tri-State New York at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

264,Welspun scandal plummeting Egyptian cotton outpu,"NEW YORK: A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U.S. big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high-end fiber market: there isn't much Egyptian cotton any more.The shortage of cotton from Egypt, which commands a premium due to its superior quality, creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether, cotton traders said, exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years.Welspun India has lost 42 percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer, one of the world's largest, accusing it of substituting cheaper, non-Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases.Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is long staple or extra long staple, meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high-end cotton than Egypt, cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop.But Egypt's cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass-produced items made from short- or medium-staple fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The decline has become a full-fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies, and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice, the USDA said.Egypt will produce just 160,000 480-lb bales of cotton in 2016/17, down from 1.4 million bales as recently as 2004/05, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of expected global output.This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not, or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure, said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville, South Carolina.If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale, and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that's produced, it would lead one to scratch one's head, Lea said.A GOLD SEAL?Long and extra long staple cotton is rare - it makes up just 2.5 percent of annual world cotton production of more than 100 million bales, according to the USDA - and trades at a substantial premium.U.S. extra long staple cotton, or pima, trades for 152.25 cents per lb, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, a 125 percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U.S., a contract that accepts cotton of a strict low middling staple length.Ron Lawson, a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma, California, said he had no idea what Egyptian cotton prices were, which he said showed how much of a novelty item the fiber was.Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U.S. Textile Act and Rules, which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target's allegations or had started an investigation.Egypt's cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting. In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's Gold Seal, which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now, Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.",8/25/2016,264,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
271,China G20 West derail agend,"BEIJING: China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage.Ensuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be.Beijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said.From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them, said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea.In recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington.While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media.China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders.State media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers.Let's make cooperation ever higher, it wrote in a commentary last week.But the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules, the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary.These new rules will exclude China.ANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIAOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia.Australia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project.But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it.Joerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies, Wuttke told Reuters.A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism.The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence, the official added.None of this will make for plain sailing at G20.China is angry with almost everyone at the moment, said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit.To be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat.It's very important from the stance of national pride, said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics.It's a minefield for China.JAPAN WORRIESThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Last week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be constructive at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States.Wang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble.Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case, Wang wrote.Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.",8/29/2016,271,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

277,Consumer giants Muslims halal face creams,"LONDON/JAKARTA: Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow.Unilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019.The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world, said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULAFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia.Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future, Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, said it is well-equipped for this niche market.Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash.The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it, said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants.Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients.Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was not material.MUSLIM VALUESCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.Some (values) are common across Muslim countries, he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication, he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)",9/2/2016,277,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
278,India Ambani telecoms venture free calls cut price d,"MUMBAI: Reliance Industries unveiled its Jio telecom network on Thursday, touting free calls and rock-bottom data prices that sent shares of established telecom players into a nosedive on fears of an all-out price war.Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, told the energy group's annual shareholders' meeting that services on the Jio network would be available for free until Dec. 31 in a welcome offer.Reliance, which has been giving freebies for the past few months as part of network testing, did not say when it would start billing customers.Reliance, one of India's biggest conglomerates which gets most of its revenue from its sprawling oil and gas business, has in recent years expanded into more consumer-facing markets such as retail and telecoms as growth slows in its core business.The company, which secured telecom airwaves in 2010, has so far invested more than $20 billion on building a nationwide network and has pledged to offer affordable services to price-conscious Indian customers.Ambani, who was interrupted by repeated rounds of applause as he took shareholders in a packed auditorium through Jio's ambitious rollout plans, free countrywide roaming offering and more, vowed to transform India from a high-priced data market to one with the lowest data rates anywhere in the world.Jio could make Reliance a big provider of telecoms and internet services across India - a nation of 1 billion mobile phone subscribers - and is a key plank of Ambani's strategy, even though the business is unlikely to add significantly to group profits any time soon.Jio will effectively price 1 gigabyte of data at about 50 rupees on average, about one-fifth of what rivals charge, Reliance said in a statement.Ambani set a target of 100 million customers for Reliance Jio in the shortest possible time, without specifying.PRICE WARShares in India's No. 1 wireless carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd dropped 6.3 percent while smaller rival Idea Cellular fell 10.5 percent, on fears that Jio's aggressive rates will trigger a price war. Incumbents have already started lowering data prices ahead of Jio's entry.Bharti Airtel said: We welcome Reliance Jio’s entry to the digital world and wish them the very best, but made no comment on the new entrant's price plans. Idea did not comment.Still, one telecom analyst with a foreign brokerage said Jio would face challenges in luring low-spending phone users to its network.Jio's cheapest of 10 plans starts at 149 rupees ($2.22) a month and offers just 0.3 gigabytes of data, while the next monthly plan costs 499 rupees for 4 GB of data. It will also offer a 299 rupee plan with 2 GB of data which has to be used in 21 days.By comparison, the monthly average revenue per user for India's telecoms industry, where many still use basic phones, was 127 rupees in the quarter ended March, according to latest data available with the sector regulator.It is definitely aggressive and will hurt the incumbents, said the analyst who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. But it's not like it's going to push everyone else out of the market.",9/2/2016,278,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
287,Tax exempt military fuel sold on open market Afghani,"KABUL: Tax-exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market, industry officials and a new anti-corruption report reveal, causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid.An AFP team witnessed first-hand evidence hinting at how duty-free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week.Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards, the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers, scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry.Among the documents from one driver was a maafinama -- a tax-exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around $200 a ton -- showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry.Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries -- responsible for Afghan military and police -- is exempted from custom duty, following a security agreement between the government and NATO.What is this fuel doing in this market? asked the official, standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations.That´s the big question, he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck, pledging a full investigation.He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasons- ´Misuse´ -No commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war-ravaged Afghanistan as fuel -- and none more at risk of being stolen, smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption, observers say.Last year, more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan, the finance ministry said, with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around $100 million.The custom duty exemption mechanism... (for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit, said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain maafinamas involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to misuse.Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies, the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP´s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he cannot confirm nor deny whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.- ´Contaminated´ -The comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label donor fatigue as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market, said the official who carried out the inspection.How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented, the MEC report said.Why not? Is the reason for the delay perhaps another instance of corruption?",9/5/2016,287,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
288,Chinas Xi at G20 says world economy at ri,"HANGZHOU, CHINA: The global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the open of a two-day summit of leaders from G20 nations.His warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U.S. president described as extremely productive, but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea.With the summit taking place after Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U.S. presidential election in November, observers expect G20 leaders to mount a defense of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism.The global economy has arrived at a crucial juncture, Xi said, in the face of sluggish demand, volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment.Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading, while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum, he said.G20 countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures - including monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.Xi also called on G20 countries to match their words with actions.We should turn the G20 group into an action team, instead of a talk shop, he said.But some of the G20 leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity.BATTLE LINESOn Sunday, Xi held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and told him he hoped Australia would continue to provide a fair, transparent and predictable policy environment for foreign investors.China was angered when Australia blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders last month.China has accused Australia of bowing to protectionist sentiment in blocking the bid for Ausgrid, as well as an earlier one by a China-led consortium to buy cattle company Kidman &amp; Co.Beijing has also criticized Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity, saying it was unacceptable the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years.Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element, he told a news conference.Britain's future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion.Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain's closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her.But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal.Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union's common market, it needed to respect the rules of the common market.Turnbull, meanwhile, said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc.LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night.He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and stressed U.S. commitments to its regional allies.Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it.According to a fact sheet on China-U.S. relations issued on Sunday, the two sides agreed on a range of issues, including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers.Obama, now in the last five months of his presidency, is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific, setting the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office on Jan. 20.His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport, where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access. Obama said on Sunday he wouldn't over-crank the significance of the airport events.None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship (with China), he told a news conference. The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation.Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou, with parts of the city of 9 million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G20 summit stays incident-free.",9/5/2016,288,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
293,Asia stocks hit one year hig,"TOKYO: The dollar took a tumble and Asian stocks rose to one-year highs on Wednesday after surprisingly weak U.S. services sector activity put paid to already slim chances of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve as early as this month.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, extending its chunky gains of 2.7 percent over the last two days, to claim a level last seen in July last year.When people think there's no immediate rate hike from the Fed, then Asia and emerging markets are the place to go to, as investors seek yields, said Toru Nishihama, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research.Japan's Nikkei slid 0.7 percent, however, as the yen gained sharply versus the dollar, putting more pressure on exporters in the world's third-largest economy.The Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 51.4, its lowest level since February 2010, from 55.5 the month before and well shy of the 55 estimate.Given the strength in the service sector has been making up for softness in the manufacturing in the past year or so, the data was a blow to the case for the Fed to raise interest rates as soon as this month.The Fed now looks certain to keep rates on hold this month, said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economics strategy group at HSBC in Tokyo.Comments from several Fed officials in recent weeks had boosted bets on a rate hike in coming months, but investors have had to scale back their expectations since Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls report.San Francisco Fed president John Williams, speaking after the ISM data, also said he expects the Fed will raise rates gradually over the next few years.Recent hawkish comments from Fed officials were probably intended to warn markets against being too complacent about the chance of a rate hike, rather than to make markets fully price in a rate hike, Shirota said.U.S. bond yields fell, with policy-sensitive two-year notes yield US2YT=RR falling to 0.730 percent, its lowest since Aug. 19, down from 0.853 percent marked on Aug. 29.U.S. interest rate futures price gained to indicate only about 15 percent chance of a rate hike this month and just over 50 percent even by December, compared to above 20 and 60 percent, respectively, before the data were released.Declining U.S. yields undermined the dollar against other currencies and precious metals. The dollar, which had slumped 1.38 percent on the yen on Tuesday, shed another 0.5 percent to 101.48 yen.The yen gained additional support from a media report that the Bank of Japan's board is struggling to agree on a common front in its planned policy review.The euro maintained Tuesday's 0.96 percent rise against the dollar, the biggest daily gain in three months on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1247.A resurgent British pound rose to near eight-week high of $1.3445 on Tuesday and held firm at $1.3416.Gold rallied to $1,352.4 per ounce to near three-week highs on Tuesday, and last stood at $1,350.0.The Australian dollar took a breather. It was last down 0.2 percent at $0.7668 after GDP data largely met expectations, with Australia's annual growth clocking its fastest pace in four years last quarter, clinching a remarkable run of 25 years without recession.Oil prices kept some distance from three-week lows touched last week, maintaining a part of gains made after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on Monday to cooperate in world oil markets, saying they will not act immediately but could limit output in the future.Brent crude futures stood at $47.49 per barrel LCOc1, up 0.5 percent on the day and above its low last week of $45.32.",9/7/2016,293,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
303,US seeks 14 bn from Deutsche Bank over mortgage bond,"NEW YORK: Authorities in the US are seeking as much as $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to resolve allegations stemming from the sale of mortgage securities in the 2008 crisis, the German financial giant confirmed Thursday.The payout would be the largest ever inflicted on a foreign bank in the United States, easily surpassing the $8.9 billion that the French bank BNP Paribas paid in 2014 for sanctions violations.But in a quick reaction, Deutsche Bank rejected the $14 billion figure, which the bank said was an opening proposal in settlement talks with US prosecutors.Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited, the statement said.The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.The US investment bank Goldman Sachs in April agreed to pay more than $5 billion to settle similar allegations.US authorities have accused major banks of misleading investors about the values and quality of complex mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the underlying lending was worthless or fraudulent, delivering billions of dollars in losses to holders of the mortgage bonds when the housing market collapsed, bringing down numerous banks and touching off the country´s worst recession since the 1930s.According to securities filings, Deutsche Bank as of June 30 had set aside $5.5 billion to resolve pending legal matters. In the mortgage-backed securities matter, the bank is aiming for an amount between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to knowledgeable sources.The US Justice Department declined to comment.Bank of America in 2014 paid out nearly $17 billion in a related enforcement action but federal authorities have faced stinging criticism for failing to hold individuals to account.In recent years, Deutsche Bank has found itself mired litigation and enforcement actions around the world.US market regulators last year fined the German lender $55 million, concluding that it had overvalued its holdings of credit derivatives by at least $15 billion during the financial crisis.In 2015 and 2016 Deutsche Bank failed so-called stress tests conducted by the US central bank that were designed to determine whether it had adequate capital strength to weather shocks such as those of the financial crisis.In June, the International Monetary Fund described the bank as a major systemic risk, leaving its chief executive John Cryan to strive to convince markets that Deutsche Bank was bound to recover.In April of last year, Deutsche Bank also paid a record $2.5 billion to settle American and British charges that it had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, affecting commercial interest rates.The bank also settled with the US Fed and New York´s Department of Financial Services of alleged sanctions violations in Syria and Iran.In July Deutsche Bank posted a 98 percent year-on-year drop in second-quarter profits, with net earnings recorded at only $22 million, which Cryan, the bank´s chief, attributed to sustained restructuring.Cryan plans to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide by 2020, while the bank´s share price has fallen to around 10 percent of its pre-crisis value.",9/16/2016,303,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
318,Australia skipper Smith plots return to test summi,"SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the world´s top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australia´s best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australia´s highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australia´s copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lord´s.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this week´s third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.It´s a huge motivation, that´s what we want to be, number one in all formats and we´re working extremely hard to get there, Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. It´s been a good summer for us so far, so we´d like to finish on a high.Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, February´s two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smith´s side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smith´s side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think that´s one of the big things we´re going to be judged on, Smith added.It´s going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but I´m confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.Smith´s own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australia´s only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again, Smith said.All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week.",1/2/2016,318,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
322,Australias spinners peg West Indies back in Sydney rai,"SYDNEY: Australia´s spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather-disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday.More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop-start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start.Denesh Ramdin, unbeaten on 23, and Carlos Brathwaite (35 not out) will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away.The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and O´Keefe got plenty of turn off a straw-coloured wicket.Off-spinner Lyon (2-68) produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwood´s off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85.Left-arm orthodox spinner O´Keefe (1-42) then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil.Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne, West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test.After the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australia´s bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravo´s miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the opener´s glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip.

371,Broad lifts England to series win in South Afri,"JOHANNESBURG: A venomous spell of fast bowling from Stuart Broad led England to an emphatic seven- wicket win over South Africa in the third Test on Saturday to clinch the series.Broad´s brilliant return of 6-17 on a lively wicket skittled the Proteas for 83 in their second innings on the third day.England reached their modest victory target of 74 with relative ease as captain Alastair Cook (43) top-scored in guiding them to 77 for three from 22,4 overs under gloomy skies.The tourists now have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series, with the final game to be played in Pretoria.South Africa bowled out England for 323 in the morning session for a slender first-innings deficit of 10 runs, but were no match for the bounce and movement of a rampant Broad as they crumbled to their second lowest Test score since returning to international cricket in 1991.Broad´s inspired spell after lunch was reminiscent of his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge last August as he tore through the South African top order aided by some excellent catching.After removing openers Dean Elgar (15) and Stiaan van Zyl (11), Broad grabbed the key wicket of captain AB de Villiers (0) when he induced an inside edge to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.It got worse for the home side when their other kingpin Hashim Amla (five) clipped the ball to James Taylor at short-leg, who showed excellent reactions to take a low catch.Temba Bavuma (0) became Broad´s fifth victim when he tried to evade a lifting delivery, but only succeeded in gloving the ball on to his stumps.Broad´s brilliant day was completed when he ended the innings with an excellent catch off his own bowling as he dived forward grab a ball that had come off the boot of batsman Faf du Plessis (14).Ben Stokes grabbed two scalps and there were also wickets each for James Anderson and Steven Finn.The latter complained after the innings of tightness on his left-side and will be assessed on Sunday.Rabada, 20, had earlier claimed his first five-wicket haul in test cricket when he bagged 5-78 to limit England to 323.It was a first home series defeat for South Africa against a team other than Australia since England won 2-1 in 2004-05.  (Reuters) ",1/16/2016,371,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
372,Brilliant Broad destroys South Afri,"JOHANNESBURG: Stuart Broad decimated South Africa´s top order with a magical spell of fast bowling that yielded five wickets and left England on the brink of victory at tea on day three of the third Test on Saturday.The hosts limped to the interval on 71 for eight after Broad returned figures of five for 14 from 10 overs on a lively wicket to leave the Proteas with a meagre 61-run lead.Faf du Plessis (12) and Hardus Viljoen (one) will seek to build a ninth-wicket partnership after the interval in an attempt to set a target that gives their bowlers some hope.Resuming after lunch on 16 without loss having bowled England out for 323 in the morning, South Africa had no answer to the bounce and movement of Broad, who moved ahead of Bob Willis into third on the list of all-time England Test wicket-takers with 329.Dean Elgar (15) edged to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and another torturous innings from Stiaan van Zyl (11) ended when he spliced the ball to Ben Stokes in the gully.The huge wicket of AB de Villiers (0) followed in Broad´s next over as he induced an inside edge to the keeper, before Hashim Amla (5) clipped the ball to short leg where James Taylor took a remarkable low catch.There were no second-innings heroics from Temba Bavuma (0) as he attempted to leave a rising delivery but only managed to glove the ball on to his stumps.Broad´s spell was reminiscent of his eight for 15 against Australia at Trent Bridge last August.There was no let-up for the home side when Broad was rested, Steven Finn removing Dane Vilas (8) thanks to another sensational one-handed catch by Taylor diving to his right.Stokes continued the procession with an excellent in-swinging yorker that clattered into the stumps of Chris Morris (0), before inducing an edge from Kagiso Rabada (16) to Bairstow.The wicketkeeper had scored a brisk 45 to help England to a 10-run first innings lead as Rabada completed a first Test five-wicket haul.The 20-year-old Rabada finished with figures of 5-78 after dismissing Joe Root (110), Broad (12) and Bairstow.England lead the series 1-0 after victory in the first Test by 241 run.

375,Sabbir heroics help Bangladesh sink Zimbab,"KHULNA: Sabbir Rehman gave an account of his all-round abilities in Bangladesh's 42-run win over Zimbabwe in the second T20 in Khulna. He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza, one of his three scalps, as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168-run chase in the ninth over.Soumya Sarkar also made 43, but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over. Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings. Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half, until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.Bangladesh started well, but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over. But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs. Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami, who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket.Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th, 14th and 15th over, but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners. Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21-ball 29 by Al-Amin Hossain in the 16th over.Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe. The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir, who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20.With a series win out of the equation, Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20.   ",1/17/2016,375,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

I broke my number one bat which was a bit annoying. I have to call Kookaburra and try and get another one from them.Virat Kohli had earlier struck a run-a-ball 117 to power India to a competitive 295 for six but the total was not enough in the end.Put into bat, India suffered an early setback as the law of average caught up with opener Rohit Sharma who, after centuries in the last two matches, fell for six in the fifth over.However, Shikhar Dhawan (68), now a Melbourne resident, batted himself back into form, raising 119 runs with Kohli before exposing his leg-stump which was pegged back by a John Hastings delivery.At the other end, Kohli became the fastest to score 7,000-runs in one-dayers, taking five less than the 166 innings South African AB de Villiers needed to reach the mark.The Indian test skipper found an able ally in Ajinkya Rahane (50), who notched up his second successive fifty, as the duo added 109 runs.Hastings, who finished with a career-best 4-58, ended Kohli´s sparkling knock of 117 that included two sixes and seven boundaries.Dropped on 20, Aaron Finch (21) could not make the most of the reprieve but Shaun Marsh (62) and skipper Steven Smith (41) added 64 runs to steady the Australia reply.At 215-6, the hosts looked in trouble before Maxwell bailed them out with some uninhibited stroke-making.Needing 65 runs off the last 10 overs, Maxwell hit Umesh Yadav for a six and a four in the 43rd over that produced 15 runs and proved the turning point in the thrilling contest.Maxwell missed his second ODI ton but belted three sixes and eight boundaries in his stellar knock to claim the man-of-the-match award as the hosts romped home with seven balls to spare.The teams now move to Canberra for the fourth one-dayer on Wednesday.

383,Sublime Verdasco sends Nadal to early Melbourne exi,"MELBOURNE: Fernando Verdasco sent shockwaves through the Australian Open on Tuesday by defeating Rafael Nadal 7-6(6) 4-6 3-6 7-6(4) 6-2 to send the former world number one crashing out in the opening round.The first-round exit was the 2009 champion's first at Melbourne Park and only his second at such an early stage in a grand slam.Down 2-0 in the final set, world number 45 Verdasco dragged himself off the canvas with a barrage of booming forehand winners, breaking Nadal twice to move to the brink of victory.He then broke his compatriot a third time, sealing the four hour and 41-minute classic with a cross-court winner that left the Rod Laver Arena crowd stunned late in the day session.I just hit everything. I think I played unbelievable in the fifth set from the break, Verdasco said in a courtside interview.I just started hitting winners. I don't know how. I was closing the eyes and everything when I was coming in.I kept doing it so it went well.After shaking hands with his opponent and the chair umpire Nadal strode quickly off the court, barely pausing to acknowledge the crowd with a wave.The only other time Nadal was beaten so early in a grand slam was when Steve Darcis sent him crashing out of Wimbledon in 2013.The match is five sets... he was playing amazing in the last set, Nadal told reporters. He had a lot of success all the balls hitting full power in the fifth.'HAPPY FEELINGS'Before the tournament, Nadal had spoken of bringing happy feelings to Melbourne Park, after arriving his healthiest in years following a taxing off-season training camp.But his exit will do little to dispel the belief that the 14-times grand slam champion's best days are behind him.Nadal failed to progress further than the quarter-final of any of the grand slams last season, his first without a major trophy since 2004.Verdasco was inspired, however, hauling himself back from the brink with a stand-and-deliver game that mixed 90 winners with 91 unforced errors.It was partial revenge for his loss in an epic five-set semi-final against Nadal in the 2009 tournament, the second longest match recorded at the Australian Open.The 32-year-old served masterfully in each tiebreak, particularly in the second to keep the match alive, but wobbled early in the fifth when he was broken early.Fortune often plays a part in the defeat of Nadal and so it proved for Verdasco, who swung wildly at a second serve with the frame of his racquet, sending the ball cross-court to clip the line and break back to 2-2.He raised his hands in apology before acing Nadal to nudge ahead and ramped up the aggression on his more fancied opponent's serve.The pressure told on Nadal, who made his sixth double-fault to concede a break point, and Verdasco outfoxed the Spaniard in a fierce baseline rally to capture the decisive break.A raging ball of fire, Verdasco roared on to complete one of his finest victories and land a hammer blow on Nadal's early season confidence.It's tough especially because it's not like (it) was here last year, added Nadal, who was beaten by Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals a year ago.This year was a completely different story -- I had been playing and practising great and working so much, so it's tough when you work so much and you arrive at a very important event and you go out so early.",1/19/2016,383,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
398,Masakadza Madziva help Zimbabwe level seri,"KHULNA: First it was Hamilton Masakadza, who scored a record-breaking 93 to help Zimbabwe post a formidable total. Then came Tendai Chisoro's three-wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2-2 with an 18-run win in Khulna.While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, Neville Madziva, the pacer, did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs.Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board. Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going. But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14-ball 18 in the seventh over.Mahmudullah, meanwhile, rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips, but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long-off. Along the way, he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13.Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6.3 overs as the scales started to tilt again. But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul, who was caught at cover. Mashrafe Mortaza, who has shown ability to wield the long handle, struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs.A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer. Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe. But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro. Abu Hider Rony swung his way around, but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts. He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win.The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket, but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80-run stand. Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes.Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes, using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck. He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil. Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25-ball 32, Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18-ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base.On the night, the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited-overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month. The jewel in Zimbabwe's twin wins to cap off their tour was Masakadza, whose 222 runs is a world record for most runs in aT20 bilateral series.   ",1/22/2016,398,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
428,Tortured Murray outlasts Raonic to reach Melbourne fi,"MELBOURNE: Andy Murray went through paroxysms of frustration but seized another opportunity to break his Australian Open jinx with a four-hour, five-set semi-final victory over Milos Raonic on Friday.Four times the British world number two has advanced to the final at Melbourne Park and four times he has been vanquished, three times at the hands of Novak Djokovic.The Serbian will again stand in his path on Sunday as the Scot seeks to add another grand slam title to his 2012 U.S. Open and 2013 Wimbledon crowns.Raonic, meanwhile, was left heartbroken after suffering a thigh injury that hampered him from the middle of the third set of the 4-6 7-5 6-7(4) 6-4 6-2 defeat.Winning tennis matches never looks like a walk in the park for Murray but for much of the contest against the Canadian, he at least had some justification for the tortured grimaces and explosions of anger that followed every setback.The 13th seed has been on fire this year and his big serve and huge forehands had one of the best returners in the game on the ropes, while his new-found net game helped him to a healthy 72 winners.Murray said earlier this week that he would waste no more energy on the histrionics but the match was just minutes old when he returned to his chair muttering curses having been broken to love in his first service game.That was to be Raonic´s only break of the match but it was enough to win the first set and, after Murray had pounced to even up the contest, he ramped up his 230 kilometre-per-hour serve to clinch the third on tiebreak.The 25-year-old Raonic, hoping to become the first Canadian man to reach a grand slam final, was feeling the injury in the fourth set but Murray had also crucially got a better fix on his serve and broke for 4-3.Raonic almost claimed it back in the next game but Murray saved two break points, falling to one knee and roaring Yes! Yes! as he pumped his fist at the ground.Murray served out the set to even up the contest again and grabbed two breaks early in the decider as the wincing Raonic´s level dropped, the Canadian´s racket feeling the brunt of his frustration after the first.Murray finished off his ailing opponent with a sublime crosscourt backhand volley to bring up a match point, which he converted with a handsome forehand winner.The 28-year-old pointed both index fingers at the roof of Rod Laver Arena before slumping into his courtside chair with a look of relief on his face.The relief will not be long-lived, however, as he will be back on the same court on Sunday attempting to dethrone five-times champion Djokovic.Murray´s older brother Jamie will be bidding for silverware on Saturday when he teams up with Bruno Soares to take on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek in the men´s doubles final.It is the first time two brothers have reached separate finals at the same grand slam.<br/> You´re not going to see it very often, Murray junior said.

411,Rabada at the double as South Africa scent victory,"PRETORIA: Firebrand fast bowler Kagiso Rabada bagged two wickets as South Africa reduced England to 52 for three at the close of day four of the final Test on Monday.The tourists, who have already won the series, need a further 330 for what would be a record-breaking victory on the final day but must do so on a wicket showing variable bounce and prodigious turn at Centurion Park.England´s hopes of an unlikely victory or survival will rest on Joe Root (19 not out) who is at the crease with James Taylor (19 not out) after Rabada gave the hosts the perfect start.The 20-year-old forced another failure from opener Alex Hales who was trapped lbw for one by a ball that kept low and jagged into him.Rabada claimed his ninth wicket of the match when he had Nick Compton (six) caught behind, the England batsman unsuccessfully reviewing what seemed an obvious edge.With a tense final day likely, England will hope that wasted review does not come back to haunt them.In between, Morne Morkel grabbed the prize scalp of England captain Alastair Cook (five) with a brilliant one-handed caught and bowled to leave the latter still 36 runs short of 10,000 test runs after a poor series.South Africa should have celebrated the wicket of Root as well, but wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock failed to take the ball after spinner Dane Piedt had drawn the batsman from his crease and beaten the edge.South Africa earlier declared their second innings on 248 for five.Hashim Amla fell four short of a second century in the match when he uncharacteristically flashed wildly at a wide deliver from Stuart Broad in the pursuit of quick runs.Amla added 117 for the fifth wicket with Temba Bavuma (78 not out), who showed great application and maturity.The highest successful chase in test matches at Centurion Park is 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Thunderstorms are forecast in Pretoria on Tuesday, though those will likely come late in the afternoon.

413,Raonic shocks Wawrinka to reach Australian Open quarter,"MELBOURNE: Milos Raonic struck a blow for the next generation of men´s tennis by flooring former champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Second seed Andy Murray, returning to court two days after his father-in-law was rushed to hospital, hit back for the old guard in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena though, banishing Bernard Tomic, the last home hope in the singles.Murray´s win capped a banner day for Britain following Johanna Konta´s advance, giving the nation men´s and women´s singles quarter-finalists at the same grand slam for the first time in nearly 40 years.Melbourne Park was rocked by corruption allegations on its opening day, and a week later, integrity fears returned as a former Australian professional player pleaded guilty to match-fixing at a Sydney court.Former world number 187 Nick Lindahl appeared in court just hours after a top global bookmaker suspended betting after heavy gambling on a mixed doubles match at Melbourne Park.The winning doubles pair dismissed suspicions over the match after being questioned by integrity officials. There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.He´s sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better, the 13th seed told reporters.

414,Murray downs Tomic to reach Melbourne quarter fi,"MELBOURNE: Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.I just felt I was very uncomfortable, Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didn´t play the game the way I wanted to but he didn´t let me.After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murray´s victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britain´s first men´s champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

415,Amla Bavuma put South Africa in driving,"PRETORIA: A patient century stand between Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma put South Africa in a commanding position at 223 for four at tea on day four of the final Test against England on Monday.Amla, a regular thorn in England´s side, was not out on 96 as he chases a second century in the match with Bavuma unbeaten on 63. The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.

416,Injured Amla stands firm as South Africa build lead,"PRETORIA: England´s nemesis Hashim Amla overcame a battered thumb and a lively wicket to post 50 not out and guide South Africa to 121 for four at lunch on day four of the final Test on Monday.The Proteas led by 254 runs on a rapidly deteriorating wicket with Amla and Temba Bavuma (nine not out) seeking to set England a record-breaking target if they are to win the series 3-0.The touring side bowled well in the morning session, with James Anderson grabbing two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.They have yet to dismiss Amla, though, as he showed great patience and steel while in obvious discomfort after being wrapped on the glove by Stokes on day three.He took his series runs tally to 424 at an average of 70.66 and remains the key in the Proteas posting a fourth-innings target they will feel is beyond England.Anderson had earlier taken his number of Test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw for a duck.It would have been a satisfying moment for Anderson after De Villiers had suggested before the game that England´s bowlers had lost pace, with many suggesting he was alluding specifically to Anderson.It was also the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.South Africa still have first-innings centurion Quinton de Kock to bat before England are in to the tail, but chasing anything over 300 on a wicket with variable bounce and movement will be extremely difficult.It would also be a record, the previous highest chase in test matches on this ground was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the test and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.

139,Gold hits three month high on shaky global economy,"MANILA: Gold edged to a three-month high on Tuesday as weak global manufacturing activity underscored the challenges for the world economy, pushing investors towards safe-haven assets.Increased volatility in other assets has benefitted gold and it could see more gains as global central banks may be forced into easing monetary policy further this year to spur growth.With rates close to zero, the only option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients.Whatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.Spot gold touched $1,130.11 an ounce, its strongest since Nov. 3, and was trading down 0.2 percent at $1,126.55 by 0226 GMT.A break above $1,136 could lift gold towards $1,157, a level reached in late October, said ScotiaMocatta technical analysts.U.S. gold for April delivery was flat at $1,127.30 an ounce.Reflecting growing confidence in gold, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 21.9 million ounces on Monday, the most since Nov. 3.Global manufacturing expansion accelerated slightly but remained weak at the start of 2016 as faster growth in developed markets failed to offset a contraction in emerging economies. In China, a gauge of factory activity fell to its lowest since mid-2012.The U.S. economy could suffer if recent volatility in financial markets persists and signals a slowdown in the global economy, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said.Gold is typically the asset of choice in times of uncertainty. It posted its best monthly jump in a year in January, and has gained more than 6 percent so far in 2016, after falling 10.4 percent last year.The Fed's statement last week that it will closely monitor the global economy and financial markets lifted gold to near $1,130, as it underlined expectations that U.S. policymakers may take it slow in raising interest rates this year.Weaker macro numbers out of the U.S. are also increasing the odds that the Fed's December move could have been an outlier, forced onto a central bank that basically had to move after promising to do so for much of the last year, said Meir who sees only one U.S. rate hike this year.Spot platinum fell 1 percent to $860.85 an ounce, palladium was steady at $500.16 and so was silver at $14.31.",2/2/2016,139,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
449,Henry Guptill superb as NZ thrash Australia by 159 ru,"AUCKLAND: Matt Henry shrugged off the disappointment of missing out on selection for next month´s World Twenty20 with a hostile spell of pace bowling that helped New Zealand ease to a 159-run win over Australia in the first one-day international on Wednesday.The 24-year-old Henry, who has been regularly overlooked this summer and then brought in as injury cover, took 3-20 in his first four overs at Eden Park as he and Trent Boult reduced the visitors to 41 for six in their pursuit of 308 to win.They were helped by an lbw decision against David Warner, who was told not to review by partner George Bailey despite the opener´s concerns about the height.Ball tracking suggested the ball would have gone well over the stumps, causing Warner to slam his bat into his pads as he watched the replay on the big screen.Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade (37) and all-rounder James Faulkner (36), however, then put on 79 runs to partially resurrect Australia´s innings as they chased New Zealand´s 307-8.Once Wade holed out at deep midwicket in the 21st over and Faulkner was bowled by Adam Milne in the 22nd, the match was all but over and they were bowled out for 148 in just 24.2 overs.Henry finished with 3-41, while Boult had 3-38. Mitchell Santner bowled just two balls and took the last two wickets.Martin Guptill top scored for New Zealand with 90, his highest total against Australia and his 29th one-day international half century.The 29-year-old opener, who hit one of his five sixes onto the roof of the stand at the Auckland venue, shared in partnerships of 79 runs with captain Brendon McCullum (44) and 100 with Henry Nicholls (61).New Zealand, who were asked to bat by Australia captain Steve Smith, had initially looked on course to set a total well in excess of 320 but lost wickets at critical times when batsmen looked set to push on.John Hastings was the most economical of the visiting bowlers with 1-39 from 10 overs, while fifth seamer Mitchell Marsh had figures of 2-35 from seven.The three-match one-day international series moves on to Wellington on Saturday with the sides also scheduled to play two Tests.

463,New Zealand set 282 for Australia in second ODI,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell-Hadlee series alive.Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late-innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon.Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott, while John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball.Nevertheless, Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time. Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing.

Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs, but the tourists could be happier with their effort. ",2/6/2016,463,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

5,us oil prices slip below 50 a barr,"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet, said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak, said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter, Cooper said.

498,Moving ball to test Australian technique in Welling,"WELLINGTON: </<Swing and seam friendly conditions, a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday.The Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and, even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off, McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat.Similarly-grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected, however, as both captains noted on Thursday.I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect, McCullum said. The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen ... (and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so, Smith said.The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.I'm looking forward to these two test matches, McCullum said. It will be a great series, two evenly matched teams.Not a better way to go out really.",2/11/2016,498,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
6,oil hits new 5.5 year lows as saudis defend,"New York: Oil prices tumbled Tuesday to fresh 5.5-year lows as Saudi Arabia blamed weak global economic growth and said it will stick to its guns on production policy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in February sank $2.11 to $47.93 a barrel, a low last witnessed in late April 2009.Brent North Sea crude for delivery in February dived $2.01 to $51.10 per barrel, the lowest level since early May 2009.The market is still worried that there are no signs that the supply glut will start falling, Nordea Markets analyst Thina Margrethe Saltvedt told AFP.James Williams of WTRG said the weakness in the market could take prices below $40 a barrel.Basically, there are continuing concerns about OPEC not cutting back, particularly Saudi Arabia, and US production continuing to grow, he said.Saudi Arabia´s Crown Prince Salman, in a speech on behalf of ailing King Abdullah Tuesday, said weak growth was to blame for the price fall, which has sliced deeply into the income of the world´s largest exporter.This development is not new in the oil market, and the kingdom has in the past dealt with it firmly and wisely, he said, adding that Saudi Arabia will maintain its same approach towards the market.That appeared to confirm Riyadh´s determination to defend its market share rather than reduce output, even if that pushes prices lower.On Monday Saudi Arabia reportedly cut its European and US export prices in order to maintain market share.

10,oil extends losses as world bank cuts growth for,"SYDNEY: Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after the World Bank cut its economic growth forecast, helping extend a rout that saw prices touch a nearly six-year low the previous session.Oil and other commodities came under pressure after the weaker outlook from the Washington-based financial institution reinforced worries of a gloomy economic outlook at a time when oil markets are plagued by oversupply.The global economy is running on a single engine ... the American one, World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said. This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1 was at $45.29, down 60 cents.There's clearly a souring of sentiment towards industrial commodities and I think that's spilling over to oil today, said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.Potentially this selling is now being overdone, but today there's no sign of a turnaround, he said.Analysts said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent, and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said. The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads, analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share, ANZ bank said.",1/14/2015,10,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

He added that the industries were facing four hours of load shedding.However, PPP’s Fahmida Mirza contradicted the minister’s figures saying that he is wrong about his statistics and that Badin was facing 20 to 22 hours of load shedding.",2/4/2015,28,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
20,new saudi king seen holding line on opec policy to keep oil output hig,"SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting, said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be, said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]This little spike in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won't last long at all, said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.",1/23/2015,20,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
23,sbp warns islamic banks to be more equitab,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be reasonably rationalised, central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue, said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.",1/29/2015,23,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

It is also above monthly data since April 1931.It´s not a pretty picture, said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. We´re seeking bottom but I don´t think we´re there yet.The oil market has collapsed by more than 50 percent since June, plagued by plentiful crude supplies, weak global demand and the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to let prices fall.If proof were needed that oil prices remain constrained by too much supply, this afternoon´s US inventory data confirmed it, said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.As such, prices could well have further to fall with prospects of a drop below $40 a barrel becoming a reality in the short to medium term.

It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.",2/2/2015,26,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

Crude prices on Wednesday snapped a three-day rally, with WTI sinking 8.7 percent owing to climbing US crude stockpiles.Analysts said prices are weighed down also by the euro´s fall on news that the European Central Bank had cut off Greek banks´ access to a key source of much-needed cash.In a decision that rattled global financial markets, the ECB said Wednesday it would no longer allow Greek banks to use government debt, which has a junk rating, as collateral for loans.The Greek situation is worth keeping an eye on as it massively impacts the value of the euro against the US dollar, said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.A sinking euro makes dollar-priced oil more expensive, denting demand and adding downward pressure on crude prices, which have already been battered by a supply glut and weak demand.Crude has lost more than half its value since June, when prices were at more than $100 a barrel.Global supplies have been boosted by surging US shale oil production and a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in November to keep current output levels.

Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. “Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices,” said a press statement from the IMF mission. “While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises,” noted the IMF.",2/5/2015,30,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world´s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

37,hsbc admits swiss bank failings over client tax,"LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures, HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain’s The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing significantly lower standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw “bricks” of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone a radical transformation in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the Lagarde List after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde.

Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply, the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring relatively swiftly, with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.This morning´s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed, said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

45,oil prices rise in asian trad,"Singapore: Oil prices edged higher in Asia Thursday but gains were capped owing to concerns about surging stockpiles in the United States, the world´s top consumer, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose 69 cents to $49.53 while Brent crude for March gained 34 cents to $55.00 in afternoon trade.There is some optimism in the market at the moment, but the fundamentals have not changed, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. The increased US stockpiles adds to the worry about ample global supply, which is the main cause for the current bearish market, he added. The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that commercial crude reserves rose 4.9 million barrels in the week ending February 6.Stockpiles were at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years, the agency added.Oil prices have been under pressure for months, plunging about 60 percent to just over $40 a barrel between June and the end of January.However, they have recovered slightly in recent weeks as the number of drilling rigs has fallen and oil companies have trimmed some investment.Investors are also monitoring talks on Greece´s demands to renegotiate its international bailout as the risk of a debt default looms. A meeting between Finance Minister Yaris Varoufakis and his counterparts from the eurozone late Wednesday broke up without agreement, with deliberations now set to go down to the wire next week. We expect price action to remain choppy as markets await for direction, said Singapore´s United Overseas Bank. (AFP)",2/12/2015,45,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

We will continue to see range-bound trading in the immediate term with little change to fundamentals, Ang told AFP. The main thing is crude production. As long as production levels don´t go down for now, it is hard to see a reversal of low oil prices, he said.Markets seem to be ready for prices to go up again. They are just waiting for a sign that production will be significantly cut. A US stockpiles report Wednesday showing crude reserves standing at an 80-year high for this time of the year has exacerbated concerns about a global supply glut. Oil prices have been under pressure for months, plunging about 60 percent to just over $40 a barrel between June and the end of January.However, they have recovered slightly in recent weeks as the number of drilling rigs has fallen and oil companies such as Total and Royal Dutch Shell trimmed some investment.

WTI then continued to fall further in late trade, dropping below $50.In London, Brent crude for April delivery was flat at $60.22 a barrel, one cent higher from a day earlier.US and Canadian output continued to rise despite the weak market, adding to the gap between the two key benchmarks.Still-rising US production and climbing inventories remain the more relevant fundamental story, said Timothy Evans of Citi Futures.Analysts at JPMorgan said reports of production and export drops in the Middle East and North Africa helped hold up London prices.An additional support also comes from higher crude demand in Europe from strong refinery margins and US refinery maintenance allowing refiners elsewhere to fill the product supply gap, they said.We continue to expect that crude markets will come under pressure in the short term, however, fundamentals point to stress on Brent-related crude outweighing that on WTI.More broadly, they said they foresee overall demand will decline as refineries adjust to different conditions, further pressing downward on prices.Assuming that Brent markets witness a reversal of the supply losses that have tightened them significantly in recent weeks, then we would expect weaker Brent cash differentials and structure to erode the support for Brent crude against other benchmarks, notably WTI.

The continuous large increases of crude inventories verify a possible slowdown of US oil demand, she added.Globally, crude supplies are being boosted after oil fields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the Hariga port after a pipeline was repaired, Bloomberg News reported.And Oman, the biggest Middle East producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.Crude prices lost around 60 percent of their value between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar that made oil expensive to purchase for holders of rival currencies.The euro continued to be pressured by the dollar Monday despite eurozone ministers tentatively agreeing to extend Greece´s bailout by four months.While oil prices have won support in recent weeks on a decline in operating US oil rigs and as energy giants cut investment, markets-watchers say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said a sustained rebound for oil prices was unlikely because of a global oversupply of the commodity, noting that US crude production has remained strong at above 9.2 million barrels per day.He said a strike in US oil refineries has led to an excess of crude in the American market as less of the product is being sent to the facilities for refining.Workers at three major US oil refineries operated with Royal Dutch Shell went on strike on Saturday in a dispute over safer working conditions, the United Steelworkers (USW) union said.About 1,350 employees in three refineries and chemical plants are affected by the latest strike action, which mirrored walkouts on other sites launched earlier this month.

US crude oil stocks surged significantly once again, noted Commerzbank analysts.Crude oil has however lost about 50 percent of its value since June, weighted down by the global supply glut.Later on Friday, traders will switch their focus to economic growth data in the United States, for clues on the health of oil demand.Investors will have plenty to look forward to today and with the second reading of US Q4 GDP data, as well as the Chicago PMI and University of Michigan sentiment index we could see further gains in crude oil on any positive surprise, said Sucden anlayst Kash Kamal.Earlier this week, prices won support from upbeat comments from Ali Al-Naimi, the oil minister of major oil producer Saudi Arabia.Oil demand is growing and the market has turned calm, Al-Naimi said on Wednesday.Saudi Arabia is the biggest and most influential member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which in November decided to maintain output levels despite a global oversupply.Prices managed to get some support amid positive comments from OPEC´s kingpin Saudi Arabia´s Al-Naimi, who said prices were stabilising and that demand was growing, said analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov at Natural Resources Consulting.However, US crude stockpiles continue to push higher amid refining strikes, weather-related disruptions and still ample production.

The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the world’s third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.",2/27/2015,62,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

70,fbr moves to widen tax net but big fish yet to be caug,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest — and most influential — to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year — barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax, FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers, Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught — several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some chronic defaulters, freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected, Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´FBR is after those who can´t influence them, Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters, Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent — but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates, a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed limited success in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme — tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender — was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.",3/9/2015,70,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
71,dollar at 12 year peak vs euro emerging markets spooked,"LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to stop wasting time and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.It is all about the Fed now, said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey. The Brazilian real led the rout, having fallen for the sixth straight session.The pressure spread then through Asia with the South Korean won hitting its lowest since late August 2013 and the Singapore dollar its lowest since 2010.Eastern Europe was also heavily in the red.

73,oil market adv,"London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar, but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel.Despite the bearish oil inventories report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported by a slightly softer US dollar, said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday.Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures rose above $48.50 per barrel.The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere, investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and other major Western powers and Iran on Tehran´s contested nuclear programme as a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic weapons. Iran denies the allegations.Prices are likely to remain in a tight range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions, said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.

Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations, said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

77,us oil price hits six year,"London: New York oil prices sank to a six-year low on Monday, falling below $44 per barrel as the market was plagued by plentiful supplies and the strong dollar.In earlier deals, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery dived as low as $43.57 -- hitting the lowest since March 12, 2009.The contract later recovered slightly to stand at $44.40, down 44 cents from Friday´s closing level. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April fell 79 cents to $53.38 a barrel in midday London trade.Crude futures had plunged by more than two dollars on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of US crude reserves reaching storage capacity with little sign of a slowdown in output despite a global glut. Selling pressure was generated on Friday by the IEA, which warned that storage capacities could soon be exhausted in the United States, said Commerzbank analysts.The reason cited by the IEA was the massive oversupply, which stems first and foremost from the still rising US oil production.The US Department of Energy last week said stockpiles in the world´s top crude consumer climbed to a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week. This week could be even more bearish for oil as there has been no shift in supply, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. Singapore-based Phillip Futures said with fundamentals remaining unchanged, we hardly find a reason for crude oil to break higher or even lower. Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 per barrel between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the soaring dollar.Prices have since rebounded following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly, the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations, said last week. McCarthy said oil prices are also under pressure owing to gains in the dollar against other major currencies ahead of a closely watched US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday. A stronger US dollar makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand. (AFP)",3/16/2015,77,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

102,Oil slides to new 11 year low over Saudi Iran r,"LONDON: Oil prices slid more than 4 percent to new 11-year lows on Wednesday as the row between Saudi Arabia and Iran made any cooperation between major exporters to cut output even more unlikely.The furore over Saudi Arabia´s execution of a Shi´ite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising, Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that China´s services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The People´s Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the world´s largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United States, concerns over mounting oil stock levels persisted, with crude inventories likely to have risen by 439,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish its closely watched weekly data at 1530 GMT.Some analysts think oil prices have fallen too far and will stage a sharp recovery later in the year, with Commerzbank targeting $60 per barrel by the end of 2016.This looks ambitious from current levels but current prices are unsustainably low, Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank, told the Global Oil Forum.We are in a speculative exaggeration at the moment.He added that he expects US oil production to fall at least 1 million bpd by autumn. ",1/6/2016,102,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was down 84 cents at $48.03 a barrel.Barclays said that the U.S. build-up in stocks would make its way into an already oversupplied market in the second quarter and that global demand would unlikely be strong enough to support oil prices once that happens.In OECD Asia, demand growth actually fell from -3 percent to -4 percent (in Q1) ... Apparent demand in China was around 2 percent higher, but actual demand is likely to be lower since seasonal stockbuilding typically takes place after the start of the year, the bank said. It added that demand growth in the OECD region had been in structural decline over the past five years.Continued dollar strength is (also) a headwind to the oil price recovery, Barclays said, forecasting the dollar rising slightly above parity with the euro by Q4.A potential climb in prices could come from an OPEC production cut, which some members have lobbied for but its biggest exporter Saudi Arabia has resisted.Saudi Arabia had to cut its price in Asia to ensure its crude oil remained attractive, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.Other suppliers looking to position themselves in Asia will have to pay close attention to the Saudi's pricing strategy, it added.Morgan Stanley said that crude demand would also be dented via the refinery sector, where production tends to fall towards the middle of the year.In the United States, the oil rig count continued to drop, although analysts said that lower drilling activity would only affect oil production later this year.The current rig count is pointing to U.S. production declining slightly sequentially in 2Q15 and 3Q15, Goldman Sachs said although it added activity could bounce back in 2016 as drillers benefitted from falling production costs.",3/30/2015,92,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

104,Saudi Iran split dashes chance of OPEC deal to curb oil glu,"LONDON: The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shi´ite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the world´s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016. The world is now producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it is consuming, and Iran is promising to add another million bpd to supply over the next 12 months.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree any caps on production at its annual meeting in Vienna last month, amid acrimony between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Gulf region´s main Sunni and Shi´ite powers.If there was still any suggestion that the two rivals might somehow overcome their animosity to agree to manage supply this year, it was buried on Monday when Riyadh called off diplomatic ties with Tehran over Iran´s response to the execution of Saudi<br/>Shi´ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.Several OPEC delegates told Reuters they now saw no chance of any improvement in relations between OPEC members, which have been already very low over the past months.<br/><br/>This new situation will just make it worse and I see no agreement to be reached within OPEC, one representative to OPEC from a member country outside the Gulf region said, on condition of anonymity.",1/6/2016,104,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
105,World Bank cuts global economic growth ou,"The World Bank on Wednesday cut its global economic growth forecast for 2016, saying the weak performance of major emerging market economies will tamp activity overall, as will anaemic showings from developed countries such as the United States.Global growth should accelerate to 2.9 percent this year from 2.4 percent in 2015, the bank said, but that still represents a downgrade from its June forecast for 3.3 percent growth.The bank raised particular concern about the flagging performance of top emerging economies.Given the size and global economic integration of the largest emerging markets - Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa, or the so-called BRICS - the simultaneous slowdown underway in all but one of them could have significant spillovers to the rest of the world, the report said.The bank forecast the Russian and Brazilian economies would continue to contract in 2016 rather than return to growth as it had estimated in its previous outlook in June.Real gross domestic product in Russia could shrink at a 0.7 percent annual pace this year, it said. In June it had forecast 0.7 percent GDP growth for 2016. The bank estimates the Russian economy shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.In Brazil, GDP is forecast to decline by 2.5 percent in 2016 compared with an earlier estimate for growth of 1.1 percent, the World Bank said. The Brazilian economy likely contracted at a 3.7 percent rate in 2015.China GDP growth was estimated to slow to 6.7 percent in 2016 from an estimated 6.9 percent in 2015. In June the bank had estimated 2016 growth of 7.0 percent.The South African economy should grow at a modestly faster rate in 2016 than last year - 1.4 percent compared with 1.3 percent - but substantially slower than the 2.1 percent growth forecast in June.Of that group, India was the only one expected to see notable improvement in economic performance from 2015 - advancing at a 7.8 percent rate in 2016 versus 7.3 percent in 2015. But even there, the bank nipped its 2016 estimate by 0.1 percentage point from its earlier forecast.The bank also trimmed its outlook for the United States and other developed economies.The U.S. economy should grow by 2.7 percent, down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent but up from 2015's 2.5 percent.Estimates for growth in the euro zone were trimmed by the same amount, to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent previously, although that would mark a modest acceleration from 2015's estimated 1.5 percent rate.",1/7/2016,105,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
106,Brent crude hits new 11 year,"SINGAPORE: Brent crude prices fell to fresh 11-year lows on Thursday as fresh concerns over China's economy added to huge storage overhangs, near-record production and slowing demand that have already pummelled prices.China accelerated the devaluation of the yuan on Thursday, sending currencies across the region reeling and domestic stock markets tumbling, as investors feared the Asian giant was kicking off a virtual trade war against its competitors. Trading on its stock markets was suspended for the rest of the day.Global oil prices have crashed 70 percent since mid-2014 as near record output from major producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and North America create a ballooning overhang that has left storage tanks around the world struggling to cope with the excess oil.At the same time, demand is slowing, especially in Asia where the biggest economy and energy consumer, China, is seeing the slowest economic growth in a generation.Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell to new 11-year lows of $33.09 per barrel on Thursday, undercutting a low from a day earlier, although prices edged back to $33.52 per barrel by 0213 GMT.Traders said a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which might normally be seen as posing a risk to oil supplies, may actually be bearish as it all but eliminates cooperation over production between the two OPEC members.Neither one of them (Saudi Arabia or Iran) is going to voluntarily cede a single barrel to the other, so it arguably makes a coordinated production cut even less likely than it has been, one Middle East oil trader said.In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures set fresh 2009 lows of $32.77 per barrel, with prices crawling back to $33.25 by 0213 GMT.Analysts said that the huge U.S. storage overhang was the main reason for falling WTI crude.Data suggest gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles increased 10.6 million barrels and 6.3 million barrels, respectively, last week. The rise in gasoline and distillate inventory more than offset the fall in crude oil inventory levels by 5.09 million barrels to (still near record) 482.3 million barrels last week, ANZ bank said.The huge storage overhang means that even if U.S. production falls this year as drillers succumb to low prices, it will take many months to work down excess supplies.With the global economy looking shaky due to China's slowdown, traders said the outlook for oil remains for cheap prices for much of this year.",1/7/2016,106,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

108,Oil moves away from 12 year lows as China shares ri,"SEOUL: Global benchmark oil futures rallied more than 2 percent on Friday, following Asian shares higher after Beijing deactivated a circuit breaker mechanism that was blamed for aggravating equity market crashes.Chinese stocks were also boosted as the yuan currency firmed in early trade after the central bank strengthened its official rate for the first time in nine trading days.Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 0150 GMT, having hit an intraday high of $34.72. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004.U.S. crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading 63 cents higher at $33.90 a barrel after settling at $33.27 on Thursday. In the last session, it hit its lowest since late 2003 at $32.10.OPEC's smallest member Ecuador, which has increased debt and reduced investments due to the oil price plunge, said on Thursday it would continue to press for production cuts at the cartel's next meeting scheduled for June.Oil remains under pressure amid concerns about China's economy, ANZ said in a note on Friday.With rising Middle East tensions now a distant memory, oil is likely to test the $30 a barrel level amid growing concerns on the impact of a weakening yuan on Chinese demand.Natixis said in a research note that global demand should increase by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) as opposed to 1.7 million bpd in 2015.There are several clouds on the horizon which may impact demand growth such as the potential slowdown in China and any other emerging markets, it said.Chart-watching oil analysts said if oil prices do not rally hard on Friday, they seem doomed to drop below $30 a barrel for the first time since 2003.",1/8/2016,108,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
109,Global stocks crater in worst week in 4 year,"The benchmark S&amp;P 500 U.S. stock index on Friday notched its worst five-day start to a year on record as fear of a slowdown in China offset a surprisingly strong payrolls report in the United States.Brent and U.S. crude futures prices extended their weekly slide to more than 10 percent, pressured by unrelenting oversupply and a bleak demand outlook.Stocks had opened higher on Wall Street after data showed the economy created many more jobs than expected in December and previous months were revised higher.But the S&amp;P 500 hit its session high within five minutes of the open and closed near its session low, down more than 1 percent on the day and 6 percent for the week.It was the largest weekly drop in more than four years and the largest 5-day slide to start a year on record.The market’s reaction (to the jobs report) is something between curious and concerning, said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.People are skittish in holding positions. If you are long stocks, you think you might be saved by this jobs report. If they don't go up, you are in trouble.”Investors fear that China, the second-largest economy in the world, is growing more slowly than expected and could further weigh on commodity prices and global economic growth.Stocks and other risk assets got support earlier from Asian markets after China nudged the yuan higher for the first time in nine days, easing fears it had lost control of the currency, and as the Chinese stock benchmark rose 2 percent.Europe initially followed suit, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 1.5 percent and lost 6.7 percent this week.MSCI's broadest gauge of stocks globally was down 0.8 percent on the day and fell more than 6 percent this week, also the largest such drop in more than four years.What's going to come out of China is a short-term concern for the market, so maybe the ... decline we've seen is not quite enough, said Andrew Slimmon, a Chicago-based portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which manages more than $400 billion in assets.He said concerns are only near-term and the beginning of earnings season will remind investors that the U.S. micro story hasn't changed.Traders are indeed more concerned near-term, with the spot price of the CBOE volatility index higher than futures three months down the line. The VIX fear index closed Friday at its highest since late September.For others, however, the mood is bleaker.The start of the year is very poor, so that's got investors on the defensive, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.In the face of weakening global growth, he said, it's difficult to find reasons to commit money at this point even if one is bullish.NO RESPITE FOR OILBrent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures seesawed through the day, settling lower after Wall Street stock prices gave up earlier strength. The two benchmarks hit 12-year lows earlier in the week.Goldman Sachs said in a note on Friday the market needs to see sustained low prices through the first quarter and that producers were not ready to slash output at current prices.Brent crude rose as much as 2.9 percent but was last down 1.2 percent on the day at $33.33 per barrel. WTI fell 1 percent to $32.95 a barrel after gaining more than 3 percent earlier.The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield hit the lowest since late October, reversing an initial rise after the strong jobs data that also showed hourly earnings were unchanged versus expectations of a 0.2 percent increase. Continued safety bids also kept yields from climbing.U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were up 10/32 in price to yield 2.1173 percent, from 2.153 percent late Thursday.The dollar climbed on measures taken by China to ease this week’s market turmoil and on the U.S. payrolls data, but gains were limited by worries over whether Beijing has done enough to calm its battered stock market.The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.0923, while the greenback lost 0.1 percent to 117.52 yen.Spot gold fell for the first time this week but gained more than 4 percent for the week, the most for any week since August.",1/9/2016,109,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

113,Gold firm on safe haven demand as stocks face headwind,"SINGAPORE: Gold edged higher on Monday, trading close to last session's nine-week high as pressure on Asian stock markets supported safe-haven bids for the metal.Asian share markets swept lower after Wall Street suffered its worst starting week in history and doubts over Beijing's economic competence sent investors into the arms of the safe-haven yen and sovereign bonds.Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,105 an ounce by 0330 GMT. U.S. gold gained 0.7 percent to $1,105.2.We have some supportive factors in the market such as Saudi Arabia-Iran tensions, devaluation of yuan which have prompted safe have appeal of gold, said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers Ltd in Hong Kong.Gold climbed to its highest since early November on Friday, adding more than 4 percent to its value this year, on concerns over the Chinese economy and tumbling stock markets.Perceived missteps by China's authorities in controlling their share market and currency have led to concerns Beijing might lose its grip on economic policy too.China will face great difficulty in achieving economic growth above 6.5 percent over the 2016-2020 period due to slowing global demand and rising labour costs at home, the China Securities Journal quoted a top state adviser as saying.Investment appetite for bullion showed signs of picking up last week. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, rose 4.2 tonnes on Thursday, data from the fund showed.Bullion is often seen as an alternative investment during times of financial uncertainty, although safe-haven rallies tend to be short-lived.Gold slid 10 percent last year on fears higher U.S. rates would lower demand for the non-interest-paying asset, while boosting the dollar. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold costlier for holders of other currencies.Silver rose 0.4 percent at $13.986 an ounce, while platinum lost 0.5 percent at $870.25 an ounce.

115,US crude oil prices approach 20 pc fall since beginning of 2016,"SINGAPORE: US crude prices continued a relentless dive early on Tuesday approaching a 20 percent drop since the beginning of the year as analysts scrambled to cut their 2016 oil price forecasts and traders bet on further price falls.US crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 were trading at $31.34 per barrel at 0805 GMT on Tuesday, down 7 cents from their last settlement and almost 19 percent lower than at the beginning of the year. WTI has shed over 70 percent in value since the downturn began in mid-2014.Trading data showed that managed short positions in WTI crude contracts, which would profit from a further fall in prices, are at a record high, implying that many traders expect further falls.Analysts also adjusted to the early price rout in the year, with Barclays, Macquarie, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered and Societe Generale all cut their 2016 oil price forecasts on Monday.A marked deterioration in oil market fundamentals in early 2016 has persuaded us to make some large downward adjustments to our oil price forecasts for 2016, Barclays bank said.We now expect Brent and WTI to both average $37/barrel in 2016, down from our previous forecasts of $60 and $56, respectively, it added.But it was Standard Chartered that took the most bearish view, stating that prices could drop as low as $10 a barrel.Given that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the USD and equity markets, the bank said.We think prices could fall as low as $10/bbl before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far, it added.",1/12/2016,115,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

116,Asia stocks cheered by China trade surpri,"SYDNEY: Asian shares made their first real rally of the year on Wednesday after Chinese trade data beat expectations, offering a rare shaft of light for the global economy.Japan's Nikkei jumped 2.6 percent from a near-one-year trough, while battered Australian stocks gained 1.3 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sped ahead by 1.6 percent and away from its lowest since late 2011.Even China's mercurial markets found some relief with the Shanghai Composite Index up 0.8 percent and the CSI300 index 0.9 percent.The good cheer spread to E-mini futures contracts for the S&amp;P 500 which climbed 0.8 percent.The gains came after China reported its exports had risen 2.3 percent in yuan-denominated terms in December, from a year earlier while imports dipped 4.0 percent.In U.S. dollar terms, China's December exports exceeded analyst expectations, falling 1.4 pct from a year earlier, while imports fell by 7.6 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall 8.0 percent and imports to fall 11.5 percent.While investors harbour suspicions about the reliability of the data, on the surface they offered hope that world trade flows were at least stabilising after a dismal 2015.It also suggested Beijing might prove successful in its increasingly forceful attempts to stabilise the yuan, so dampening fears of a sustained devaluation.All of which galvanised currency markets where the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, was up half a U.S. cent at $0.7036.With safe-haven suddenly out of favour, the Japanese yen and the euro eased broadly. The U.S. dollar moved up to 118.22 yen from an early 117.61, while the euro slipped to $1.0815 from $1.0860.Against a basket of currencies the dollar gained 0.2 percent.Likewise, low-risk sovereign debt had to surrender a little of their recent gains and yields on 10-year paper nudged up 3 basis points 2.137 percent.The hint of firmer demand from China provided a reprieve for commodity prices, which have been under the hammer for months.U.S. crude edged up 44 cents to $30.88 a barrel a day after diving as deep as $29.93 to break the $20 barrier for the first time in 12 years.Benchmark Brent was quoted 31 cents higher at $31.17 a barrel.

It hit a 12-year low of $29.93 earlier this week.WTI is on track to post a third consecutive weekly loss, down more than 6 percent.The contract is down nearly 18 percent from a 2016 high on January 4.Brent crude was down 20 cents at $30.68 a barrel.The global benchmark settled up 72 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $31.03 a barrel on Thursday, after falling to $29.73, its weakest since February 2004.Over the previous eight sessions, Brent had lost about $7 a barrel, almost 20 percent.Western sanctions on Iran are expected to be lifted within days, potentially paving the way for more crude oil exports from the country, under a landmark agreement on Tehran´s disputed nuclear programme.This is three or four months ahead of what the market was thinking last year, so it just adds fuel to the fire, said Tony Nunan, Oil risk Manager, Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo.Iran has removed the sensitive core of its Arak nuclear reactor and UN inspectors will visit the site on Thursday to verify the move crucial to the implementation of the atomic agreement with major powers, state television said on Thursday.Any additional oil from Iran would add to the glut that has pushed oil prices into a deep slump since the middle of 2014.It is the wrong time for Iran to be returning to the oil market, both for the market and likely also for Iran, Phillip Futures said in a note on Friday.It would have been so much more ideal for Iran to return to the oil scene if prices were soaring at $100, it said.",1/15/2016,118,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

127,Asia stocks get welcome respite as crude prices bou,"TOKYO: Battered crude oil prices bounced back from their lows on Thursday, propelling solid gains in Asian shares and the dollar.Thursday's gains built on Wall Street's consolidation overnight in which major indexes finished with declines of more than 1 percent, but well off the 3 percent plus they plumbed in the previous session when U.S. crude had dropped to 2003 lows.New front-month U.S. March oil futures fell nearly 4 percent on the day to close at $28.35 a barrel, but they were up 1.2 percent in Asian trade at $28.70, a far cry from the expiring contract on U.S. crude for February delivery, which slid 6.7 percent to settle at $26.55.Brent crude rose 1.4 percent to $28.27 in Asian trade.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended early gains and was up 1.4 percent while Japan's Nikkei average added 1.5 percent, clawing back some of the 3.7 percent it plunged in the previous session to a 14-1/2 month closing low.Perhaps this stock market rebound comes from the usual suspects: Short-covering and bargain-hunting. However, today's results alone should not be seen as proof of an upward trend, said Hiroki Allen, chief representative of Superfund Securities Japan.China's bluechip CSI300 index was down 0.5 percent in early trade, and the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.8 percent.The dollar bounced back from a one-year low against its perceived safe-haven Japanese counterpart. The greenback added about 0.4 percent to 117.38 yen after falling as low as 115.97 on Wednesday, even as it marked impressive gains against some emerging market currencies.It is not your ordinary day in the foreign exchange market when the Russian rouble and the Mexican peso hit record lows while the Hong Kong dollar falls to its weakest level since 1999, said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.Emerging market countries bear the brunt of the selling because the slowdown in global growth and volatility in commodities causes significant economic damage for these countries, she said in a note to clients.U.S. data out on Wednesday undermined the dollar overnight. U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December, suggesting inflation was more sluggish than the U.S. Federal Reserve believed.Other Wednesday data showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month, which led investors to pare expectations of further interest rate hikes this year.The euro edged down about 0.2 percent to $1.0870, ahead of the European Central Bank's regular policy meeting later in the session.

128,Oil prices stretch gains on cold US European weather,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose for a second session on Friday, moving further away from 12-year lows plumbed earlier this week, as cold US and European weather as well as firmer financial markets gave some traders reason to cash in on record short positions.While benchmark crude futures on both sides of the Atlantic were poised for their first weekly gain this year, analysts cautioned the price rally was unsustainable given soaring inventories amid persistent overproduction.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 17 cents at $29.70 per barrel at 0206 GMT, around $3.50 away from a 12-year low of $26.19 hit earlier this week. Prices were headed for a 1 percent weekly rise.WTI prices could test a resistance at $30.85 based on a Fibonacci retracement measured from the downtrend between Jan. 4-20, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.International benchmark Brent was up 24 cents at $29.49 per barrel, off a 12-year low of $27.10 and set for a 2 percent gain for the week.Oil prices drew support from freezing weather conditions and snowstorms that have gripped the US East Coast and parts of continental Europe like Germany, lifting demand for heating oil. However, meteorological data in Reuters shows that the current cold snaps will likely to be short-lived.The cold weather in North America and Europe follows an extremely mild start to the winter in large parts of the northern hemisphere that had led to weaker-than-usual demand for oil, exacerbating a plunge in prices earlier this year.Traders said that a lot of people with open short positions in the market, which profit from falling prices, had decided to cash in when prices plunged 30 percent between the beginning of the year and the middle of this week. They have now flipped into buying at low costs, lifting oil futures.More stable global markets are likely to see speculative buying re-emerge in commodities that have suffered heavy losses in recent weeks. However, these rallies are likely to remain short-lived, ANZ bank said.Analysts said the fundamental reason for low oil prices remained unchanged, with producers around the world pumping over 1 million barrels of crude every day beyond demand, leaving storage tanks brimming.US crude inventories rose 4 million barrels in the last week, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).At 486.5 million barrels, US crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years, the EIA said.",1/22/2016,128,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
129,Crude extends gains after surge on short covering cold,"SEOUL: Crude oil futures extended gains on Monday following a surge at the end of last week on short-covering and fuel demand triggered by freezing weather in parts of the northern hemisphere.Oil prices soared 10 percent on Friday, one of the biggest daily rallies ever, as bearish traders who had taken out record short positions scrambled to close them, betting the market's long rout may finally be over.Brent had gained 8 cents to $32.26 a barrel by 0221 GMT after touching $32.69 a barrel earlier in the day. It settled at $32.18 a barrel in the previous session.U.S. crude rose 5 cents to $32.24 a barrel, compared with its session-high of $32.64 and previous settlement at $32.19.A change in investor sentiment was the key factor, with speculative short positions in WTI falling from historically high levels the previous week, ANZ said in a note on Monday, referring to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude.Low crude oil prices continue to negatively impact high cost U.S. oil producers. Indeed, recent Baker Hughes data suggested U.S. oil explorers idled more oil rigs this week.Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao said on Monday that Brent oil faces resistance at $32.72 per barrel, and may hover below this level for one day or retrace to support at $30.98, before rising again.A massive snowstorm on the U.S. East Coast helped stoke demand for oil for heating, helping push up crude prices. While New York and Philadelphia were getting back to business, Washington was not ready after an historic storm dumped more than 20 inches (51 cm) of snow on the city and nearly three feet (1 metre) in surrounding areas.Asian stocks gained early on Monday, relieved after seeing Wall Street rally on the back of a sharp rise in crude oil prices.

130,Asia stocks rise after US snowstorm rescues oil pri,"TOKYO: Asian stocks moved further away on Monday from four-year lows struck last week, as the blizzard on the US East coast pushed oil prices higher, relieving some of the bearish pressure on Wall Street and world markets.Global equities also took heart from the European Central Bank signalling last week additional monetary easing steps to come, raising hopes that other central banks, like the Bank of Japan, would take the same path.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2 percent, putting further distance between a four-year low plumbed last week.Shanghai stocks added 0.9 percent, Tokyo's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent and Australian shares advanced more than 1 percent to a 10-day peak.The latest rebound in oil, combined with European and Japan central bank's hinting at further stimulus, has provided a short-term reprieve for what so far this year, can be described as a nervous and punishing market, said Gary Huxtable, client adviser at Atlantic Pacific Securities.On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 2 percent and the Dow added 1.3 percent Friday as a cold snap in North America and Europe caused a rally in oil prices. The S&amp;P energy sector surged 4.3 percent.Both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan hold policy meetings this week, with the Fed meeting on Jan. 26-27 and the BOJ meeting immediately after, on Jan. 28-29.Investors will look for any hints of when the Fed intends to make a second interest rate hike, while there is speculation that the BOJ could opt to take additional easing measures.We expect no action from the Fed or BOJ, although investors will be looking for a more dovish forward bias as the renewed decline in oil prices lowers inflation expectations globally, wrote strategists at Barclays.Risk aversion amid fears of a China-led global slowdown and oil prices sinking to 13-year lows had rocked global markets at the start of the year, and the lull in flight-to-quality seen towards the end of last week weighed on safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR nudged up to 2.05 percent after rising to as high as 2.089 percent on Friday, the highest in a week.The dollar was steady at 118.795 yen after surging 0.9 percent on Friday, when it touched a two-week high of 118.88.

131,Gold hits two week high as equities retreat agai,"MANILA: Gold climbed to a two-week high on Tuesday as falling equities burnished bullion´s safe-haven draw, and the dollar also came under pressure as the Federal Reserve meets against a backdrop of a slowing global economy.Risk appetite soured again as equities and crude oil resumed their decline, boosting gold demand.Spot gold touched a session peak of $1,111.26 an ounce, its loftiest since Jan. 8, and was up 0.3 percent at $1,110.86 by 0313 GMT.Gold might go for a run, said Brian Lan, managing director at gold dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore, adding the metal can test $1,138, a level last reached in November.If that is breached, it could go to $1,160.U.S. gold for February delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,111.50 an ounce.Indications that a wobbly global economy may limit the opportunity for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year also supported gold.The Federal Open Market Committee starts a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and is widely expected to leave its federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25-0.50 percent.The probability of another rate increase at the next Fed meeting in March has eased, with some analysts seeing it postponed to later in the year.That puts downward pressure on the dollar and benefits gold, which has gained nearly 5 percent so far this year after declining in 2015 for a third year in a row.At this week´s meeting, it is likely that the Fed will reiterate its dovish stance and this should push gold prices up, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients.Meir said the poor shape of the U.S. equity market shows a major capitulation will be needed in order to clear out much of the selling, suggesting investors should keep a bullish gold bias in the near term.Spot platinum was down 0.3 percent at $855.74 an ounce, but well off last week´s seven-year trough of $806.31.Platinum is forecast to average less than $1,000 an ounce in 2016 for the first time in more than a decade as global growth concerns and demand fallout from the Volkswagen scandal grip the market, a Reuters poll showed.Spot palladium slipped 0.3 percent to $488.50 an ounce and silver gained 0.2 percent to $14.27.",1/26/2016,131,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
132,Asia stocks find support oil still unstab,"SYDNEY: Asian shares pushed back into the black on Thursday as investors dipped their toes back into equities and demand for safe haven assets such as the yen and sovereign bonds faded.A bounce in oil prices offered some salve to strained nerves. While Brent crude was off 23 cents at $32.87 a barrel, this followed a 4 percent jump on Wednesday after Russia hinted at co-operation with OPEC on oversupply.U.S. crude eased back 21 cents to $32.09.After starting weaker, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan swung 0.4 percent firmer in very choppy trade.Likewise, Japan's Nikkei turned 0.3 percent higher having been down more than 1 percent at one stage. Shanghai's Composite Index was just a whisker lower.The initial losses followed a poor finish on Wall Street, though dealers noted E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 had since rebounded by 0.65 percent.The Dow had ended Wednesday with losses of 1.38 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.09 percent and the Nasdaq shed 2.18 percent.Apple's shares fell 6.57 percent after the iPhone maker reported its slowest-ever rise in shipments, while Boeing lost 8.9 percent in its biggest fall since August 2011.The blame for Wall Street's fall was laid at the door of the Federal Reserve, with investors apparently frustrated the central bank was not concerned enough about the global outlook to scale back its plans for policy tightening.Rather, the Fed left all options open, including a hike at the next meeting in March.We have no doubt that the market was looking for a 'Fed put' via some commentary about the committee growing increasingly nervous about financial markets and the global backdrop, wrote Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBCCM.Instead, the Fed chose the pragmatic route.The reaction to the Fed in currency markets was much more muted. The dollar gained on the safe-haven yen to 118.88, while the euro was sidelined at $1.0883.Against a basket of currencies, the dollar edged up 0.12 percent.The New Zealand dollar fell more than half a U.S. cent after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said low inflation meant further policy easing may now be required, having previously flagged that it would not cut rates further.The kiwi dollar fell to $0.6428, from around $0.6480.There is little in the way of market-moving economic data out of Asia. In Europe, Britain's fourth-quarter growth data looms large for the embattled pound.Annual economic growth is expected to have slowed to 1.9 percent, from 2.1 percent, an outcome that could push expectations for a hike in interest rates even further out.

The price of high-speeddiesel (HSD), mostly used in mass transportation and agriculture, could also be cut by Rs11 per litre (13.6 per cent).

141,Crude oil prices steady in thin Asian trading,"SINGAPORE: Crude oil futures steady in lacklustre trading on Friday as Asian liquidity faded ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday across large parts of the region.International benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at $34.50 per barrel at 0426 GMT, up 4 cents from their last settlement. U.S. crude futures were up 8 cents at 31.80 a barrel.Traders said liquidity was low due to the Lunar New Year holiday which will last for most of next week.Oil prices have been extremely volatile since the start of the year, and in particular this week, as a string of bullish indicators like a slump in the dollar and potential talks on output cuts clashed with bearish reports of record U.S. crude inventories, higher output and a slowing global economy.Volatility should remain elevated with the trade-weighted U.S-dollar, headlines and macro concerns continuing to drive oil prices, Morgan Stanley said on Friday.BMI Research, a unit of rating agency Fitch Group, said on Friday that bloated crude inventories in the U.S. pose rising risk to WTI and that a continued build in storage over the coming six to eight weeks could collapse the price of WTI, driving a sharp reopening of the spread to Brent.U.S. crude inventories climbed 7.8 million barrels in the week to Jan. 29 to 502.7 million barrels. Gasoline inventories rose to a record high, soaring 5.9 million barrels to 254.4 million barrels.Brimming storage is contributing to an overall bearish market outlook as long as major producers don't reach an agreement on output, with China's economic slowdown now showing signs of spreading across the world.Commodities brokerage Marex Spectron said that the macroeconomic environment is bearish. Global industrial production, manufacturing and automotive demand indices all point towards weakening demand.Rebalancing will take longer, keeping prices low ...

142,Asia stocks slip in holiday thinned trad,"TOKYO: Asian shares got off to a rocky start on Monday after mixed U.S. jobs data helped sink shares on Wall Street, but trade was thin with many regional markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, with Australian shares slipping about the same amount.Japan's Nikkei pared early steep losses, helped by a weaker yen, but it also was down 0.2 percent by midday.We didn't get much clues on future U.S. rate hikes from the jobs report, so investors are having hard times deciding their positions, said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.Japanese companies' earnings reports are not helping sentiment, either, so the market may stay sluggish for a while.U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by just 151,000 jobs last month, falling well short of expectations for a rise of 190,000.But the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, and wages rose, indicating some signs of underlying strength in the labour market despite the weak headline figure.With Singapore, Hong Kong and mainland China all closed for the new year holiday, volumes will be well below average and there tends to be a build-up of global leads that is released once Asian investors return to their desk – expect 'release valve trading late in the week, Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients.Markets in China, a focus of recent market concern, will be closed for the entire week for the holiday.Data released over the weekend showed China's foreign reserves fell for a third straight month in January, as the central bank dumped dollars to defend the yuan and prevent an increase in capital outflows.Beijing has been struggling to underpin the yuan, which faces depreciation pressure as China's growth rate slows to its lowest levels in a quarter of a century.Just as China's persistent accumulation of foreign reserves in the first decade of the 21st century signalled that its managed currency was undervalued, its persistent loss of foreign reserves signals that the yuan has become overvalued by market criteria, economist Bill Adams at PNC Financial Services Group said in a research note.There is a large probability that China's central bank tires of spending its foreign reserves to defend an overvalued currency in the near future. The People's Bank of China will likely widen the currency's trading bank and permit a larger managed slide against the dollar in coming months.Also over the weekend, North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket drew international condemnation.On Wall Street, major U.S. indexes logged both daily and weekly losses. The Nasdaq Composite led session losses, plunging 3.25 percent after a spate of disappointing forecasts from the technology sector.Recently weak U.S. economic data has led investors to pare bets on a steady pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.Speculators slashed bullish bets on the U.S. dollar for a sixth straight week through Feb. 2, as net longs fell to their lowest level since roughly the third week of October, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.In currency markets, the dollar index which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1 percent to 97.131, well above a nadir of 96.259 plumbed last Thursday, its lowest since October.The dollar rose about 0.4 percent to 117.26 yen moving away from Friday's 2-1/2 week low of 116.285 in a week in which it logged a 3.6-percent slide, its biggest weekly drop since July 2009.The euro edged down about 0.2 percent to $1.1135 though it remained in sight of Friday's three-month high of $1.1250 scaled immediately after the headline figure of the payrolls data led investors to reduce their bets on further Fed rate hikes.The Australian dollar added 0.3 percent to $0.7081 after plunging nearly 2 percent against its U.S. counterpart on Friday.Crude oil futures edged higher, against a backdrop of hope for steps by oil producers to address the global supply glut that has led to recent steep selloffs.Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi discussed cooperation between OPEC members and other oil producers to stabilise the global oil market with his Venezuelan counterpart on Sunday, according to state news agency SPA.But nothing was decided, so wariness kept gains in check.

151,Asia stocks drop as banking sector concerns smoulder,"TOKYO: Asian stocks dipped early on Wednesday amid growing concerns about the health of the global banking sector, particularly in Europe, while the safe-haven yen stood near a 15-month high versus the dollar.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent.Australian stocks dropped 2.3 percent, stooping to a 2-1/2-year trough. Japan's Nikkei, which sank more than 5 percent Tuesday, extended losses to hit a 16-month low. It was last down 2.1 percent.Equity markets remained wobbly after being hit hard early in the week by worries about the health of the euro zone banking sector, with very accommodative monetary policy seen crimping bank profits and their ability to repay debt.Trouble for equities has meant a boon for government bonds, with the Japanese government bond 10-year yield at minus-0.035 percent after dropping into the negative for the first time on Tuesday. The U.S. Treasury benchmark yield stood near a one-year trough and the 10-year German bund yield was at its lowest in 10 months.The yen and Swiss franc, often sought in times of financial market turmoil, have also received strong boosts this week. The dollar traded at 114.74 yen after sinking to a 15-month low of 114.205 overnight. The greenback traded close to 0.9695 franc, a four-month low touched on Tuesday.Concerns about European banks are contributing to the risk off mood in markets. In addition, U.S. data this month has been weak and Fed officials appear to be toning down on rate hikes, said Shinichiro Kadota, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Japan.The euro was flat at $1.1298 after scaling a four-month high of $1.1338 overnight on the dollar's broader weakness.After a tumultuous start to the week, markets looked to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's congressional testimony later in the session for fresh cues on the policy outlook, which may provide some relief for markets.While Yellen is expected to defend the Fed's first rate hike in a decade last year and likely insist that further increases remain on track, any signs of a departure from such a stance in the wake of global growth concerns could provide risk assets with a breather.The narrative that she faces is that the U.S. economy and asset markets are being sucked into the downdraft caused by oil, China, emerging markets, reserve manager and sovereign wealth fund asset selling, commodities, currency war, the strong dollar, weak European banks, weak Japanese banks, weak US banks and policy ineffectiveness...to name a few, wrote Steven Englander, global head of FX strategy at Citi.In commodities, crude oil prices trimmed some of their sharp losses suffered overnight. U.S. crude was up 2 percent at $28.50 a barrel. Crude sank nearly 6 percent on Tuesday after weak demand forecasts from the U.S. government and a rout in equities pressured prices.Spot gold fetched $1,191.76 an ounce, within reach of a 7-1/2-month peak of $1,200.60 struck on Monday on the back of risk aversion in the wider markets.",2/10/2016,151,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

147,Gold on course for longest winning run since 2011,"MANILA: Gold edged up to near its highest since June on Tuesday, as uncertainty over global growth that has hammered stocks puts the precious metal on course for its longest rally since 2011.Tuesday would mark gold's eighth straight day of gains as investors seek safe havens in the face of instability in other financial markets, although liquidity was slow in Asia with China shut for a week-long Lunar New Year holiday.Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,193 an ounce by 0250 GMT. The precious metal rose as high as $1,200.60 on Monday, its strongest since June 22 last year.If gold sustains its gains later on Tuesday, it would be its longest rally since an 11-day run in July 2011.While it's quite clear that one of the drivers here is a weaker U.S. dollar, it does appear that risk appetites are diminishing and that of course means more demand for gold, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.It's not impossible we could see another touch of $1,200, some consolidation and then potentially a move higher if current conditions prevail.The dollar briefly crashed through the 115-yen level to its lowest since November 2014 as a selloff in European and U.S. stocks continued into the Asian session, spurring demand for the Japanese currency, another safe haven.Bullion gained 5 percent last week, its biggest such increase since July 2013, boosting gold bulls' expectations that the price can go higher as global headwinds could make it tough for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.U.S. gold for April delivery was off 0.3 percent at $1,194 an ounce.Underlining gold's rising draw, holdings in eight major gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rose to 43.3 million ounces on Friday, the highest since July 2015.More significant was the rapid pace of inflows since the start of the year, having risen more than 8 percent and the biggest five-week surge since March 2011.We remain quite upbeat on gold's prospects over the short-term given the continued unease surrounding the global equity markets, the weaker dollar and gold's much stronger technical profile, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note.The next stop for gold could be $1,205/$1,215 and further to $1,235, said Meir.Spot silver rose 0.6 percent to $15.39 an ounce, near Monday's three-month high of $15.46. Platinum gained 0.5 percent to $925.80 an ounce, also near a three-month peak of $931.76 reached overnight.

We have repeatedly said that Iran will increase its crude output until reaching the pre-sanctions<br/>production level.The freeze plan has so far failed to push up oil prices, due to concerns Iran would not participate and that a deal would do little to ease the global glut as it would still allow Russia and Saudi Arabia to keep pumping at near record levels.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino, Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada sat down with Zanganeh at 3 p.<br/>m.

Greater investor risk appetite erodes demand for gold, while increased scrap adds to supply as major consumers are shying away from physical purchases.Top consumers China and India have turned sellers of gold as prices rally. Discounts in India have hit a record high, while prices in China have also turned cheaper relative to the global benchmark, in a sign of waning demand.Gold has gained this year largely on the back of turmoil in stock markets and concerns over the global economy. But the metal has given back some of those gains as markets have stabilised.The volatility index, which measures implied volatility of stock options and is often seen as an investor fear gauge, fell below 20 percent this week, hitting the lowest closing level since early January.HSBC's Steel said the recent decline in gold prices doesn't mean the rally is over, adding that demand for bullion exchange traded funds and possible weakening of the dollar could support the metal.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 2.64 percent to 752.29 tonnes on Monday, the highest since March 2015.The 19.33-tonne inflow matches Friday's increase, which was the fund's biggest single-day inflow since August 2011.The fund's inflows since the beginning of the year have already surpassed outflows for the whole of 2015.Among other precious metals, silver ticked up after hitting a two-week low of $14.90 an ounce on Monday. Platinum declined, falling towards a two-week low hit in the previous session, while palladium firmed.",2/23/2016,170,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
173,Oil prices dip on continued oversupply,"SINGAPORE: Crude oil prices dipped in early trading on Friday as reports of a meeting by oil producers to freeze output failed to convince traders that enough effort was being made to rein in ballooning global oversupply.The drop in prices came after oil markets rose late on Thursday on the back of strong US gasoline demand and what ANZ bank called a perennial hope that OPEC members can coordinate supply.That hope was stoked by reports that OPEC-members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, as well as non-OPEC producing giant Russia, would meet in March to discuss capping crude oil production at January levels.But the rally did not last into Friday as traders estimated that a freeze in production would not reduce a glut that has pulled down prices by 70 percent since 2014.International Brent crude futures were trading at $34.89 per barrel at 0139 GMT, down 40 cents from their last settlement. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 21 cents at $32.86.Capping production at January levels, when the market was pumping out well over a million barrels of crude a day above what consumers need, will in no way reduce overcapacity. In fact, given that Iran has started to return to markets since January, it'll worsen the glut, said one senior oil trader.Iran is hoping to increase its crude exports by 1 million barrels per day within the next year after international sanctions against it were lifted in January. The sanctions had cut Iran's exports by more than half from a pre-sanctions peak of almost 3 million barrels per day in 2011.Despite the glut, prices did receive some support this week from strong demand for gasoline, especially in the United States.The idea that gasoline demand is actually rising suggests that perhaps the lower prices of crude are actually prompting a greater usage of this product (gasoline), said Vyanne Lai, oil analyst at National Australia Bank.I think the market is reading this as a positive sign in terms of demand.",2/26/2016,173,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

180,Saudi Arabia expected to raise April crude prices to Asi,"SINGAPORE: Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to raise prices for most of the crude it sells to Asia in April, following robust demand for Middle East grades, trade sources said on Tuesday.The official selling price (OSP) for flagship Arab Light could rise by about 50 cents a barrel from March, a Reuters survey of five refiners showed.Benchmark Dubai prices fell below $30 a barrel at the start of this year, boosting demand for Middle East and Russian crude in Asia.That pushed up prompt prices against future-dated ones, narrowing the market´s contango structure, one of the triggers for the OPEC kingpin to raise prices.In theory, it (Arab Light) will go up 60-70 cents, a trader with a North Asian refiner said, but added that a rise of 30-40 cents was more likely as it would have to compete with crude from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).The approach of the peak summer driving season in the United States may support a bigger price hike for Arab Extra Light on stronger demand for gasoline blendstock, he said.Three of the respondents expect Saudi Arabia to limit the price increase for Arab Heavy as the grade has become more expensive than Iraqi Basra Light for March.Basra Light crude loading in March, with an API gravity of 30 degrees, is 15 cents a barrel cheaper than Arab Heavy, a second North Asian refiner said.Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.State oil giant Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom´s monthly OSPs.",3/1/2016,180,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
181,Gold extends losses on robust US data higher shar,"SINGAPORE: Gold dipped for a second straight session on Wednesday, as global equities and the dollar rose following strong US manufacturing data that rekindled speculation of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.Other safe-haven assets also fell, with the Japanese yen nursing broad losses, having suffered a big reversal overnight as traders in London and New York took a brighter view on the global economy.Spot gold slipped 0.4 percent to $1,226.56 an ounce by 0247 GMT, after dropping 0.5 percent in the previous session.The selling (in gold) will likely continue going into Wednesday's session, especially if we see another round of strong buying set in over global equity markets, said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.All this goes to show us that gold still remains very much in the orbit of US equities and we suspect that this will remain the case for some time to come, he said.The US S&amp;P 500 Index jumped to an eight-week high on Tuesday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped to their highest since early January on Wednesday.Shares got a boost after data showed US manufacturing appeared to stabilize in February, with production accelerating and new orders holding steady at higher levels.The economic outlook was further bolstered by another report on construction spending that scaled a more than eight-year high in January.The US dollar rebounded against the yen and hit one-month highs against the euro on Tuesday, making commodities priced in the greenback expensive for holders of other currencies.Investors will be watching more US data to gauge the impact on stocks and the Fed's monetary policy, with the most important one being US non-farm payrolls on Friday.So far this year, gold has gained 16 percent as turmoil in equity markets and concerns over the global economy triggered speculation that the Fed will not raise US interest rates any further this year. The US central bank hiked rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December.For now, gold is also drawing support from flows into bullion-backed exchange traded funds (ETF). Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold ETF, rose 1.15 percent to 786.20 tonnes on Tuesday, the highest since September 2014.In physical markets, India's gold imports in January surged 62 percent compared with the same period last year, news agency NewsRise Financial reported on Tuesday, citing a government official.",3/2/2016,181,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
182,Asia shares scale seven week,"SYDNEY: Asian shares were bound for a third straight session of gains on Thursday as upbeat data on US jobs and a rally in a range of commodities whetted risk appetites globally.Notably, oil shrugged off record high US crude stockpiles as investors chose to focus on an OPEC plan to freeze production, keeping alive talk the market had bottomed from a near two-year selloff.US crude edged up a further 9 cents to $34.75 a barrel, while Brent also rose 9 cents to $37.02.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added another 0.9 percent to reach a seven-week top, having surged 2.6 percent on Wednesday.Higher prices for copper and iron ore helped Australian stocks rise 0.8 percent to their highest in almost two months. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.8 percent, on top of a 4-percent jump the previous session.Value is starting to snap back and some sectors that pretty recently were hanging around all-time lows are showing signs of life, said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.The general updraft in oil is helping confidence as well. Investors aren't yet ready to take on a lot of risk, but they are adding to their positions.Energy and bank stocks had led Wall Street higher on Wednesday, giving the Dow a gain of 0.2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.41 percent and the Nasdaq 0.29 percent.The calmer mood showed in the CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, which closed at its lowest level so far this year.Sentiment was underpinned by a report showing US private sector jobs rose a surprisingly strong 214,000 in February, adding to speculation Friday's payrolls report would also be upbeat.NOT SO FASTYet fissures remain in the global outlook, argued Justin Fabo, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank.Despite the latest bounce in commodities, prices were still very weak and a lot of money had been borrowed on the assumption that they would not be.China has huge potential to roil markets as the nation navigates a difficult structural transition, he said. Asian trade, traditionally a bellwether for global growth, is in recession.Risk is being repriced, and the ability of central banks to keep pulling rabbits out of the hat is now pretty limited.Indeed, there are plenty of worries the European Central Bank could disappoint expectations for aggressive easing when it meets next week - just as it did in December.Back then markets reacted violently when the central bank's stimulus steps stopped far short of what had been priced in, leading the euro to rocket 3 percent in just one session.Fearing a re-run, investors are holding back on shorting the euro, keeping it at $1.0871 and off a one-month trough of $1.0825. The dollar also faded a little on the yen to 113.70, after losing grip of a two-week high at 114.56.Instead, the limelight was stolen by the Australian dollar which neared its 2016 peak in the wake of surprisingly strong domestic economic data.The Aussie was taking in the view at $0.7306, up 0.3 percent on the day following a 1.7 percent rally on Wednesday.Investors warmed to the currency after data showed fourth quarter economic growth unexpectedly picked up to a healthy 3.0 percent annual clip.",3/3/2016,182,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

It´s a process that could take longer, a senior US Treasury official told journalists on Saturday.The thing that would be very disruptive to confidence is if this becomes a highly confrontational process, he said.Britain´s new finance minister Philip Hammond on Saturday met his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble and tweeted: We agree we need a deal that works for the people of Britain &amp; Germany.At a family photo on Sunday, Hammond was seated in the front row, but spent most of the event conversing only with one of his neighbours, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim.The IMF has expressed alarm over Britain´s looming departure from the EU.<br/> ´Brexit´ marks the materialisation of an important downside risk to global growth, IMF staff said in a report ahead of the meeting.The IMF recently lowered its forecasts for global growth this year and next by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1 percent and 3.4 percent respectively.But with ´Brexit´ still very much unfolding, more negative outcomes are a distinct possibility, the report said.Other challenges threaten: a slowdown in the Chinese economy, as well as terrorist attacks and the failed coup in Turkey -- which have rattled financial markets.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is caught in a fundamental transition to making domestic consumption the key driver instead of massive public spending and cheap exports.At an earlier meeting in Chinese commercial hub Shanghai in February, the G20 finance chiefs agreed to use all policy tools including monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural change to boost growth.The IMF has called on some countries, notably Germany and the United States, to boost spending on infrastructure, which has been opposed by Berlin.The world economy is beleaguered with many serious problems, China´s Lou said on Saturday.We should make monetary policy more forward-looking and transparent, enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy... so as to support stronger recovery of the world economy.",7/24/2016,203,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

That is up more than a third from a low hit in January, when prices fell to levels not seen since 2003.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were trading at $36.63 a barrel, up 71 cents from the last close and 40 percent above lows touched in February.It looks at this stage as if it (oil) has formed a little bit of a bottom and perhaps we're going to see a sustained price in the $30s, maybe trending back up to $40 dollars at some point, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress.Le Brun said an improved economic outlook was pushing prices: The macro picture takes all corners of the globe into account, and those corners seem to be improving ... and that's where I'm seeing the oil price tick higher.Analysts said that strong US payroll data had pushed markets on Friday and early Monday, but that attention was now shifting to Asia.Morgan Stanley said on Monday that China's parliament, the National People's Congress, which opens its annual session this week listed to ease market barriers for transport, oil, and gas among key policy targets this year.On the supply side, US energy firms cut oil rigs for an 11th week in a row to the lowest level since December 2009, data showed on Friday, as producers slash costs.Drillers removed eight oil rigs in the week ended March 4, bringing the total count down to 392, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said.Beyond a tightening supply outlook, traders said a shift in sentiment was also lifting prices as they shut down short positions and abandoned bets on further falls in prices.Trading data shows that the number of managed short positions on WTI contracts - which would benefit from lower prices - have fallen more than a quarter since mid-February, with many new long positions betting on rising prices being opened.Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets said there's a good prospect that Brent could hit $40 ...

Meanwhile, ahead of a US Federal Reserve policy meeting, fed fund futures were barely pricing in one more hike this year.Additionally, China's February exports data released in morning trade disappointed analysts' expectations, falling 25.4 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell by 13.8 percent.Still, risk sentiment was broadly upbeat as the impressive rally in commodities markets spilled over into an array of assets such as the high-yielding Australian dollar and mining giant Glencore, which is up 5 percent and 35 percent, respectively in a week.Some investors talked about a potential bottom being formed in the commodity markets as large bearish bets are unwound and hopes of more coordinated measures from oil-producing countries to stem tumbling prices grew.Brent crude futures jumped to as high as $41.04 per barrel on Monday, extending their recovery from a 12-year trough of $27.10 hit in January. US crude futures also rose to $38.11 per barrel, its highest since early January.Further improving the mood in the battered commodity sector, spot iron ore price surged almost 20 percent, hitting a near nine-month high on the back of China's plans to boost short-term output.Ecuador's Foreign Minister, Guillaume Long, said his government will host a meeting in Quito on Friday with Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico to reach consensus over oil, especially prices.In the currency market, investors rushed back to commodity-linked currencies, sending the Australian dollar to as high as $0.7486 on Monday, its highest in almost eight months.The Aussie last stood at $0.7424.The Canadian dollar also firmed to a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3262 per US dollar and last stood at C$1.3290.In Latin America, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Colombian peso all hit multi-month highs.While the dollar was soft in general, major currencies saw limited moves.

190,Oil prices dip on stronger dollar demand concer,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped on Wednesday, weighed down by a strengthening US-dollar and concerns over slowing demand, although falling US production lent crude markets some support.US crude futures CLc1 were trading at $36.46 per barrel at 0219 GMT, down 4 cents from their last settlement, but still almost 40 percent above February's 2016 and multi-year low.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $39.54 per barrel, down 11 cents from their last close, but still some 40 percent above their January lows for this year.The dips came as the dollar reversed recent losses against a basket of leading currencies overnight, potentially hampering oil demand as imports of dollar-traded crude get more expensive.But analysts said the main reason for the dip in prices and at least temporary end to the rally was concern over faltering demand in China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a generation.The recent oil rally is looking overextended ... China's export data was horrendous, Matt Smith of Clipper Data said in a daily report.China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years.Although China imported record crude volumes of 8 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, analysts expect this figure to fall as the government scales back purchases of strategic reserves, and car sales begin to fall as the sharpest economic slowdown in a generation starts to show results.The price dips at least temporarily halted a price rally that started in mid-February on hopes that a coordinated freeze in production would stop growth in a global supply glut of at least 1 billion bpd above consumption that helped pull prices down as much as 70 percent since 2014.But OPEC-member Kuwait, this week poured cold water on hopes of such a freeze by stating that it would only cap output if all major producers participate, including Iran, which has balked at the plan.One key factor in determining the oil market balance will be US output, which the government said would be 8.19 million bpd in 2017, down from over 9 million bpd currently.But with demand growth also slowing, many analysts including influential bank Goldman Sachs, say that it will take time for markets to fully rebalance.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that it expects the annual average (oil) price for 2016 being lower than 2015 and then recovering in 2017, reflecting large oversupply and high stock levels during the first half of 2016.It added that the main risks to its forecast were changes in demand in China and the extent to which Iran manages to increase oil exports after sanctions against it were lifted in January.",3/9/2016,190,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

193,Tobacco off Saudi shelves amid price rise speculati,"RIYADH: Cigarettes had disappeared from the shelves in some Saudi cities on Sunday amid speculation on social media that the government was about to raise prices on tobacco and other products that are harmful to health.Three Riyadh shops visited by Reuters said they had no cigarettes for sale and social media users reported the same in Jeddah on Saturday and Sunday.Some suggested retailers were holding back stock until the government announced higher cigarette prices.In Dammam, the capital of Eastern Province, at least one shop was already selling packets of Philip Morris-branded cigarettes for 15 riyals ($4) instead of the 10 riyals previously charged, a smoker there told Reuters.The Finance Ministry said in the country´s 2016 budget statement in December that it would apply additional fees on harmful goods such as tobacco, soft drinks and the like, but gave no date for the increased prices.Saudi Arabia wants to reduce the bill for state-subsidised healthcare for its citizens, who suffer globally high rates of obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.Its budget strained by low oil prices, the government is also trying to boost its non-oil revenues. The local Sabq.org news website quoted the Saudi Customs Authority as saying on Saturday that tobacco prices had doubled, but there was no notice of that on the government body´s website, or that of the Commerce and Industry Ministry.Neither body could immediately be reached by telephone. An executive at a tobacco distribution company told Reuters that Saudi Customs had doubled its import fee for a consignment that he tried to bring into the country on Sunday.Shoppers in Riyadh said sugary soft drinks were still available in stores with no change in price. ",3/13/2016,193,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
194,Oil prices stable as market seen bottoming but oversupply linger,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable in early trading on Monday, with global oversupply and slowing economic growth weighing on markets but prospects of falling production lending some support.US crude futures were trading at $38.41 per barrel at 0239 GMT, down 10 cents from their last settlement.But international Brent futures were up 6 cents at $40.45 a barrel.While Morgan Stanley said that oil prices had likely bottomed out, it warned that a slowing economy and high production would prevent sharp rises.Oil prices now seem to have bottomed, even though they are likely to stay subdued for the rest of this year before starting to move higher in 2017, the US bank said, adding that cheap oil had not provided the economic boost to growth that many had hoped for.When oil prices are falling below production costs, the income gains for consumers will be smaller than the costs to producers and falling oil prices become a negative-sum game, it said.For 2016, the bank said it was no longer looking for an acceleration in 2016 GDP growth and that the risk of a global recession was now 30 percent.Following a 70 percent price rout between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil markets are in flux.Many analysts expect a modest price recovery, while others see another slump.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday said that oil prices had bottomed out due to US and other output cuts outside the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The US rig count fell for a 12th straight week last week to a total of 386, its lowest since December 2009 as drillers continue to slash capital expenditure.Others, like Goldman Sachs, warn that ongoing global overproduction, which continues to see over 1 million barrels of crude produced in excess of demand every day, will pull prices back down again.So far, demand in core markets like China remains strong.China's January-February refinery throughput rose 4.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier to 87.08 million tonnes (10.59 million barrels per day), official data showed on Saturday.The data release came shortly after China reported record daily crude imports of 8 million barrels per day.In traded markets, sentiment leans towards higher prices, with the amount of managed short positions open for US crude, which would profit from falling prices, down over 40 percent since mid-February, while the amount of trades betting on price increases stands near record highs.The shift in sentiment in commodity markets continues to gather strength ...

195,Bangladeshs bank governor resigns after 81 mn stolen in cyber hei,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's central bank governor Atiur Rahman resigned on Tuesday following demands of accountability from the government after $81 million was stolen from the bank's U.S. account in one of the largest cyber heists ever.Rahman, who returned to Dhaka late on Monday after attending a weekend International Monetary Fund conference in New Delhi, told Reuters that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had accepted his resignation.The government also fired two deputy governors of the bank, Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said, days after blaming it for keeping the government in the dark about the theft.Rahman, 65, said he resigned to set an example in a country where there is not much precedence of accountability and to uphold the image of the central bankI took responsibility, Rahman said.A former finance secretary, Fazle Kabir, would be the new governor, the finance minister said.Unknown hackers breached the computer systems of Bangladesh Bank and attempted to steal $951 million from its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which it uses for international settlements, between Feb. 4 and Feb. 5.They managed to transfer $81 million to entities in the Philippines, and the money was further diverted to casinos there.More than $30 million of the money that was stolen was handed over in cash to an ethnic Chinese man in Manila, a Philippines senator looking into the suspected laundering scheme said.Bangladesh Bank officials have said there is little hope of apprehending the perpetrators and recovering the money would be difficult and could take months.Rahman's exit could be a blow to Bangladesh, a South Asian nation of 160 million. The country has been aspiring to reach middle-income status, and Rahman was seen as one of the driving forces helping Dhaka towards that goal.A former development economics professor, Rahman took over as the central bank governor in May 2009, and was nearing the end of his second term. One of his signature achievements has been shoring up the country's foreign exchange reserves, which have increased four-fold to $28 billion under his watch.He also tried to ensure farmers and women entrepreneurs had better access to banking services and credit.He has set a good example by taking the responsibility for this incident, said Wahid Uddin Mahmud, a professor of economics at Dhaka University.   ",3/15/2016,195,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

He has donated more than $24.3 billion to the Gates Foundation and family charities since 2006.Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has roughly 90 business units including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.In June, Buffett called Bezos a classic example of how a business owner could thrive, by having focused at Amazon on how to delight customers, and keep them coming back, rather than simply process their orders.",7/29/2016,213,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

228,Strong US July jobs numbers a likely boost for Cli,"WASHINGTON:  The US economy generated more than a quarter of a million jobs in July -- a bigger-than-expected gain that will likely provide valuable ammunition for Democrat Hillary Clinton as she and Donald Trump battle for the White House.The new numbers released Friday -- which sent US stocks soaring -- were also accompanied by upward revisions of May and June data in a sign the job market in the world´s largest economy is healthier than previously thought.Non-farm payrolls rose by 255,000 positions in July while the unemployment rate remained stable at 4.9 percent, the Labor Department reported. Forecasts had called for a much more modest increase of 185,000 jobs.Private businesses and government employers added 292,000 jobs in June, not the 287,000 first reported, and 24,000 jobs in May, not the very low, downward-revised figure of 11,000.This month´s report confirms that the Great Recession is indeed in the nation´s rearview mirror -- the economy has added jobs for 70 consecutive months, the longest streak on record, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said.On the White House campaign trail, Clinton has painted a picture of optimism and jobs growth, while Trump has cast America as an economy in decline -- Friday´s numbers can only help Clinton.The Trump campaign sought to downplay the news, with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller saying the recovery was the weakest since the Great Depression, with conditions largely disfavoring working people.Entire communities have been wiped out by off-shoring, said Miller.<br/>Many workers today are earning less than they did in 1970, and household incomes are down nearly $2,000 under the Obama administration./>< Fed rate hike?The closely watched jobs figures help fill out a complex economic picture for market observers eager for signs of whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year.Monetary policy makers earlier this year veered off a course of planned, successive rate hikes as some signs emerged that the American economy might not be on sure footing.The Commerce Department said last month that economic activity had grown by a paltry 1.2 percent in the second quarter.But that data was at odds with Friday´s rosier jobs report. Employment rose in all sectors of the economy, helping to keep the rate of unemployment at 4.9 percent amid an increase in the number of people entering the labor market looking for work, said Chris Williamson of IHS Markit.Adding to the good news was an improvement in pay growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent against expectations of a mere 0.2 percent rise, said Williamson, noting that pay growth was still below pre-crisis rates.Gains were strongest in professional and business services, with 70,000 new jobs added, and in health care, where 43,000 new jobs added. Together, both sectors have added nearly a million jobs in the last 12 months, according to the Labor Department.Employment in mining continued to fall, losing 6,000 positions from the prior month and putting the industry down 220,000 jobs since a peak hit in September 2014.The average workweek rose 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours while average hourly earnings inched upwards by 8 cents to $25.69, up 2.6 percent since the start of the year./><Stocks upEquities markets reacted favorably to the news, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at 2,182.87, about four points above the all-time record set last month.The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also set a record, closing up 1.1 percent at 5,221.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 1.0 percent at 18,543.53, only 12 points from its record.We believe the trend remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining over time, said Jim O´Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.Today´s report helps the case for more Fed tightening before too long -- if strength is sustained -- although officials are being ultra cautious/dovish as they worry about downside risks, he added.",8/6/2016,228,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

There's a lot of oil there, and we don't need more of it.Meanwhile, the number of oil rigs drilling in the United States rose for the sixth consecutive week to 381.The combination of factors led analysts to warn that the world had not yet dealt with the overhang of physical oil, which could drag prices lower again before any sustained recovery.The proper signals are not yet being sent to fix the product market, Morgan Stanley said in a note, noting that refined products also needed to draw down a large excess.In other words, physical oil markets likely need to get worse before they get better.",8/8/2016,229,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,237,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
238,Dubai plane crash survivor hits 1m j,"DUBAI: It´s been an eventful few days for Mohammad Basheer Abdul Khadar, an Indian living in Dubai.In the space of a week, he survived a crash landing at Dubai airport then won $1 million in a lottery organised by the airport´s duty free operator, Gulf News reported.The 62-year-old was flying home from holidays with family in India when the Boeing 777 in which he was travelling caught fire on landing with 300 people on board.The accident on Wednesday shut down the Middle East´s busiest airport for several hours, forcing authorities to cancel hundreds of flights. All the passengers and crew escaped unharmed, but a firefighter died tackling the blaze.Just six days later, Khadar discovered that the lottery ticket he´d bought on the way to India was now worth $1 million.A fleet administrator with a Dubai car dealership, Khadar told Gulf News he habitually bought a lottery ticket on his way to visit family in the southern Indian state of Kerala.Ticket number 845 in the Millenium Millionaire draw at the airport´s Dubai Duty Free proved to be his winning shot.I live a simple life, and now that it´s my time to retire, I feel like God gave me a second life when I survived the plane crash, and blessed me with this money to follow all this up by doing good things, he told Gulf News.Khadar has lived in Dubai for 37 years and is married with two children, one of whom is paralysed after a fall early on in his childhood, reported Gulf News.Khadar told Gulf News he was planning to return to Kerala to retire and would use the money to help children in Kerala who need financial support.He said he earns around $2,200 (2,000 euros) a month, and would continue to work as long as he could.Nothing else can give you the satisfaction of your hard-earned money, he said.",8/11/2016,238,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
239,Sales Tax initiatives check huge tax evasi,"ISLAMABAD: The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.The Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.“We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages,” he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",8/12/2016,239,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

281,Spain proposes former minister linked Panama Papers World B,"MADRID: Spain has nominated as its World Bank representative a former industry minister who resigned following allegations of links to offshore dealings which emerged after he was named in the Panama Papers.The Economy Ministry said in an e-mailed statement late on Friday night that the Spanish government had proposed Jose Manuel Soria as executive director at the World Bank.Soria, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned as minister in April following reports of alleged links to an offshore company on the British island of Jersey in order to limit any damage to Spain's caretaker government, the conservative People's Party (PP).Soria's resignation came ahead of Spain's national election in June, its second in seven months, which ended as inconclusively as the previous one in December..The nomination was announced when acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy from the PP failed at the second attempt to win a new term, increasing the likelihood that Spain will have to hold its third election in year.In what could become another public embarrassment for the PP caretaker government, plagued by a string of corruption scandals, the opposition Socialists have said they will demand Economy Minister Luis de Guindos urgently appear in parliament to explain the reasons for the government's nomination.The PP has faced a slew of investigations over allegations of misappropriating public funds and influence peddling, which have seen several of its politicians resign. The PP has denied it has a problem with corruption, saying the cases are isolated and it is tackling them.The World Bank's 189 governors are expected to vote on Soria's candidature as part of the process of appointing 25 executive directors.The Spanish government examines the suitability of candidates based on their track record in public service as well as on their experience when selecting for international posts, the Economy Ministry said.",9/3/2016,281,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

India has become the most favoured nation in the world for foreign direct investments. India has outpaced some of the biggest nations in the world with its growth rate, GDP (gross domestic product).India´s GDP expanded 7.6 percent in 2015-16, making it the fastest-growing major economy in the world and outpacing its rival China´s growth rate.He went on to thank all political parties for clearing earlier this month the long-awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill, which had been blocked by the opposition since he came to power in 2014.The bill will replace a patchwork of central and state levies on goods and services and marks India´s most significant economic reform in decades.Modi said his government had been successful in bringing down retail inflation from double digits to six percent, adding that he was working with the central bank to lower prices to four percent with a plus or minus-two percent band.I will continue to strive hard to ensure that this inflation doesn´t affect the food plate of the poor, he said.",8/15/2016,243,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

The sanctions were lifted in January.Investors are wondering: if Iran doesn´t participate in any such discussions, would Saudi Arabia still be amenable? Aw said.At around 0700 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September was down 36 cents, or 0.79 percent, to $45.38 and Brent crude for October dropped 41 cents, or 0.85 percent, to $47.94.Nigerian Petroleum Minister of State Emmanuel Kachikwu in a Twitter post Monday also voiced doubts about output cuts by OPEC.On oil production cuts by OPEC, optimism on my part is quite sparse, he said. OPEC member Nigeria is Africa´s biggest oil exporter.Oil prices had entered a bear market at the start of the month on oversupply concerns, falling more than 20 percent and closing below $40 a barrel for the first time since April.Any agreement to curb production would help rebalance the crude oil market, where output has been running ahead of demand.The chances of a deal actually occurring at next month´s OPEC meeting are minimal, Angus Nicholson, a strategist at IG Markets, said in an email commentary.The Saudis are happy to commit to some sort of OPEC-wide supply freeze deal so long as Iran is party to it.

247,British shoppers begin feel post Brexit pi,"LONDON: From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britain´s decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.The consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the country´s tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pound´s plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar group´s London office.We wouldn´t expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices, he told AFP.Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.- Diluted purchasing power -Price comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming fears of Brexit for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexit´s tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited, warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.Companies may well look to clamp down on workers´ pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",8/17/2016,247,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

250,Oil dips Asia Saudi Arabia output boost repor,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices eased slightly in Asia Thursday amid reports OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia would further raise output in August.Prices hit five-week highs this week, supported by hopes that a Russian-Saudi cooperation may reach a pact to freeze output, easing the stubborn supply glut dogging the market since late last year.OPEC members and their non-OPEC rivals are to meet informally in Algeria next month, and both Saudi and Russia have indicated they could discuss measures to stabilise prices.The market was boosted further on Wednesday after the weekly US inventories report showed significant declines in commercial crude stockpiles, indicating strong demand in the world´s top oil consumer.US crude stockpiles fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to August 12, and gasoline stocks declined 2.7 million barrels, official data showed.Analysts however, said gains were being eroded by media reports that Saudi Arabia, OPEC´s top producer, is ramping up production to fresh record levels in August.Saudi output was at a record 10.67 million barrels per day in July.The upside is capped by Saudi´s signals of pumping more oil in August, which could give the Kingdom more leverage during talks in Algeria next month, said EY Services oil and gas head Sanjeev Gupta.The oil market will continue to seesaw amid scepticism over the coordinated efforts to stabilise output, he told AFP by email.At about 0500 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery was down two cents to $46.77 while North Sea Brent was down 16 cents to $49.69. Both contracts closed higher Wednesday.Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, said prices are on the slide as optimism faded for a freeze production agreement... after Iran communicated little interest in the arrangement.A Saudi-led attempt to freeze output at January 2016 levels failed in April after rival oil producer Iran refused to be part of the deal, saying it needed to raise production dented by years of Western economic sanctions, which were lifted in January.What needs closer monitoring are the industry-sourced reports that Saudi Arabia could boost crude oil output in August to record levels, Innes said.IG Markets´ Melbourne-based analyst Angus Nicholson said there were concerns that Saudi Arabia may continue producing oil at their summer output levels rather than following their usual seasonal slowing of production.",8/18/2016,250,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

254,Bangladesh Black Sea wheat India supply fad,"SINGAPORE: Grain millers in Bangladesh are boosting their wheat purchases from Russia and Ukraine as cargoes from key exporter India fade due to a supply squeeze in that country.Bangladesh has booked about 800,000 tonnes of wheat from the Black Sea region for shipment between mid-July and October, up from around 550,000-600,000 tonnes in the same period last year, two trade sources said.Strong demand from South Asia's top wheat importer and other key buyers could help buoy benchmark futures, which have been recovering from a 10-year low of $3.99-1/4 a bushel hit earlier this month due to pressure from plentiful global production.India is out of the market, Bangladesh buyers are taking larger volumes of feed wheat as well as milling grade wheat from Russia and Ukraine, said one Singapore-based trader.It is all about prices, most Bangladeshi millers take the cheapest origin.Buyers paid $155-$168 a tonne, free on board, for Black Sea feed wheat with about 10.5-percent protein content, the sources said. They declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.For milling wheat with 11.5- to 12.5-percent protein, importers have paid $165-$180 a tonne FOB, they said.India has been exporting wheat to Bangladesh for the last few years, but its recent crops have been hit by a severe drought linked to the El Nino weather pattern and by unseasonable rains.BIN-BUSTINGRussia and Ukraine, two of the Black Sea region's leading wheat producers, have seen bin-busting grain production.Ukraine's 2016 grain harvest is likely to be around 3 million tonnes bigger than the year before at around 63 million tonnes, agriculture ministry official Leonid Sukhomlin said earlier this week.And Russia is facing a lack of grain storage as it remains on track to produce the largest cereal crop in post-Soviet history, said the head of Russia's Grain Union.But analysts warned against relying too heavily on shipments from the Black Sea.Worldwide, many countries are depending on Russia to supply much of their wheat and that is risky, said one agricultural commodities analyst. There could be delays.Much of the Middle East and North Africa has heavily booked wheat shipments from the Black Sea region, taking advantage of lower prices.Traders said there is already a delay of 10-12 days for ships waiting to load wheat at Russian ports.Bangladesh has also booked about 200,000 tonnes of higher quality Canadian milling wheat, the sources said.",8/19/2016,254,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

258,Illicit gold Indias smugglers shut out refiners b,"MUMBAI: Indian gold refiners just months ago were ramping up capacity and struggling to secure enough ore from miners. Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.Gold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called grey market where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations, James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold. With local scrap supplies we can produce 20 tonnes of refined gold in the current year, said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.SMUGGLING GROWSIndia raised the duty on gold imports to 10 percent three years ago, aiming to dampen buying and narrow the current account deficit in a country where gold is seen as a store of wealth for rich and poor alike.Smugglers evade the duty and offer cheap gold to buyers such as bullion dealers and small jewelers, who can pay up to $100 an ounce below official domestic prices, currently around $1,340 an ounce.Falling gold prices deterred the illicit trade last year but smuggling has surged in recent months amid rising prices and the reintroduction in March of a 1 percent local sales tax on gold jewelry.Smuggled gold into India could double to as much as 300 tonnes in 2016, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, although the World Gold Council (WGC) has put the figure at 160 tonnes. At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.BANKS HITThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets, Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent, he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount, said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business, said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

Along with Egypt and Jordan, Pakistan was a newcomer to the LNG import market in 2015, helping drive up demand and absorb growing world supplies from a wave of new projects.The new import terminal will be able to receive 600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and is expected to be commissioned for operations by mid-2017.The terminal will reduce Pakistan's gas deficit by 30 percent and ensure fuel for 3,600 megawatts of new power generation plants being constructed in the country, said PGPL chairman Iqbal Ahmed.Pakistan started up the 3.5 million tonnes per year Engro Elengy LNG terminal, the country's first LNG import facility, in Port Qasim last March.

260,Paris tourism lost 750 mln euros after,"PARIS: Militant attacks, strikes and floods kept foreign tourists away from the French capital in the first half of the year and cost the Paris region tourism industry some 750 million euros ($849.38 million) in lost revenue, officials said on Tuesday.It's time to realise that the tourism sector is going through an industrial disaster. This is no longer the time for communication campaigns but to set up a relief plan, Frederic Valletoux, head of the Paris region tourist board said in a statement on Tuesday.Valletoux said massive investments were needed to protect jobs in the sector and he urged Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault to quickly meet with local tourism officials.About 500,000 people in Ile-de-France have jobs linked to tourism, making it the biggest industry in the regionFrance, which is seeking to revive its economy, depends heavily on tourism, which generates over 7 percent of national gross domestic product and over 13 percent of that of the Ile-de-France region, which includes Paris, the world's most visited city.France's tourism industry has suffered since Islamic State gunmen killed 130 people in an attack in Paris last year. It was dealt further blows in July when a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice. Two weeks later, two men killed a priest in a small town in Normandy. Strikes against a controversial labour reform and floods in June also deterred tourists.Nightly hotel stays were down 8.5 percent in the Paris-Ile de-France region in the first half, with an 11.5 percent decline for foreign tourists and a 4.8 percent drop for French tourists.Japanese visitors were down 46.2 percent in the first half compared with the same period in 2015, while Russians were down 35 percent, Chinese down 19.6 percent, and Americans down 5.7 percent, the Paris region tourist board statement said.France is the most-visited country in the world, with almost 85 million foreigners last year, including 16 million in Paris.Weak activity in France contributed to a fall in first-half operating profit for French group AccorHotels.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industry also said that it had no comment.A senior industry source who was involved in the Australian submarine bidding called the allegation an extraordinary attempt to deflect attention from DCNS' security shortcomings.Clearly there's been a massive leak. And for the French to seek to blame either the Japanese or the Germans under some banner of 'economic warfare' is hysterical, he told Reuters.The French victory in one of the world's most valuable defence contracts was a major blow to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to develop defence export capabilities as part of a more muscular security agenda.Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne visited Tokyo this week to meet with her Japanese counterpart, Tomomi Inada, in the first such visit since the contract was awarded.DCNS and TKMS are currently locked in another competition for a lucrative contract to replace Norway's fleet of aging Ula-class submarines.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $2.80 an ounce at $1,323.10.Gold whipsawed on Friday, rising as much as 1.5 percent in the immediate wake of Yellen's comments, before slipping back to end the day marginally lower.The market was surprised (by Yellen) -- that is why it went all the way up first, before losing it all, Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland, said. The demand for physical (gold) is still very poor, so it feels like we may need to test lower levels first before a surge in price.Gold's volatility tracked fluctuations in the dollar. The U.S. currency gave up gains soon after Yellen spoke as she gave no indication that a rate hike was imminent, but rebounded as traders reassessed her words, and after Fed Vice Chair Fischer said the Fed was still on track to lift rates this year.Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.The pressure on gold will likely increase as we go into September, as participants are now more willing to bet on a rate hike given what they have gleaned from top Fed officials on Friday, INTL FCStone said in a note.Hedge funds and money managers increased their net long position in COMEX gold contracts in the week to Aug. 23, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.Silver was little changed at $18.61 an ounce, having earlier touched its lowest in more than eight weeks at $18.36 an ounce.Platinum, the biggest faller among the major precious metals last week, was up 1 percent at $1,077.60 an ounce, while palladium was down 0.2 percent at $684.38 an ounce.",8/29/2016,270,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

339,Sledging helps Bavuma knuckle down for maiden Test,"CAPE TOWN: Tiny Temba Bavuma scored his maiden Test century for South Africa on Tuesday and suggested English sledging helped him reaching the landmark.The 25-year-old was 102 not out when the hosts declared on 627 for seven late on the fourth day as the second Test headed for a draw.The cheers that greeted the milestone, which came after an entertaining knock of just 141 balls, raised the roof at Newlands.They were words of encouragement if I can put it politely. The (English) guys did say a lot but I think it was all in the spirit of the game, Bavuma told reporters.Maybe it assisted me to knuckle down out there. I kind of enjoyed it.<br/> It was almost like being back at school where guys used to come hard at me because I was short.Standing five foot six inches tall, Bavuma is playing his seventh Test and his innings will be a major boost for South African cricket as the authorities try to ensure the racial make-up of the team is more reflective of the country´s society.I am quite relieved, full of emotion and very satisfied from a personal and team point of view, Bavuma said.I´ve been wanting to cross off that first test hundred and to do it at my favourite ground was extra special.Bavuma was born not far from Newlands in the black African township of Langa.I think pressure is always there and as young guy I´m at start of my international carer and I really want to make use of the chances I´ve been given as well as make a mark for myself, he said.His parents missed his debut against the West Indies at the same ground one year ago but flew in from their holiday to watch him this time.I´m sure that moment was full of emotion for them too, he said.Bavuma, 25, waited for almost six hours before getting his chance as captain Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis batted South Africa out of danger in a marathon partnership.I slept a bit on the balcony for some of those hours and I just tried to keep clam and wait for my opportunity and enjoy the success of the guys out there, he said.

274,Oil prices rebound on weaker dollar,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday, rebounding on a weaker U.S. dollar after falling around 3 percent or more in the previous session following a surprisingly large build in U.S. crude and distillate stocks last week.The weaker dollar is providing support for oil prices today. The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar, said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday. A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities including oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.U.S. crude futures had climbed 12 cents to $44.82 a barrel by 2025 EST, after falling $1.65, or 3.6 percent, in the previous session.Brent crude futures climbed 10 cents to $46.99 a barrel after settling $1.33 lower, or 2.8 percent, at the previous close.That came after U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels to 1.221 billion barrels in the week to Aug. 26, data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again, Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal. The market doesn't believe OPEC has the ability to achieve an agreement freezing supply, Barratt added.Investors are also waiting for U.S. non-farm payroll data on Friday to give the market direction, ANZ Bank said in a note.",9/1/2016,274,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
276,Indonesia turns India buffalo beef alternativ,"JAKARTA: Indonesia's procurement agency has reached an initial agreement to import an extra 70,000 tonnes of buffalo meat from India this year, as it seeks to balance the effects of food import controls aimed at improving self sufficiency.In principle they both agree. We'll discuss the details today, Bulog procurement director Wahyu said on Friday, referring to discussions with the trade and agriculture ministers.Wahyu, who like many Indonesians goes by one name only, said the deal would bring Indonesia's total buffalo meat imports to 80,000 tonnes in 2016.The buffalo meat imports are intended to help stabilize meat prices that have climbed as a result of beef and cattle import restrictions.Buffalo meat imports provide a meat alternative to the community that's cheaper, healthy and Halal, Bulog CEO Djarot Kusumayakti told reporters.According to trade ministry data, beef currently costs around 115,000 rupiah ($8.68) per kg. Bulog is selling buffalo meat for 65,000 per kg at a consumer level.President Joko Widodo said earlier this year he wants fresh beef to cost around 80,000 rupiah per kg.Indonesia, which has the world's biggest Muslim population, imports virtually all of its cattle from Australia - a trade that was worth nearly $600 million in the last financial year.Indonesia is pushing importers to start breeding their own cattle as part of efforts to reduce its dependence on imports.Last year, Indonesia had to cull millions of chickens to ease supply swings and issued more import permits for cattle to cool beef prices.Bulog will also import 260,000 tonnes of raw sugar this year, most of it from Brazil, Bulog CEO Djarot Kusumayakti told reporters.In June, Southeast Asia's largest economy said it would control wheat imports that had jumped after corn imports were capped this year.($1 = 13,251 rupiah)",9/2/2016,276,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
279,Oil heads for biggest weekly loss since mid January,"SINGAPORE: Crude prices rose on Friday after losses of more than 3 percent a day earlier, with investors treading cautiously ahead of key U.S. employment data that will help gauge the health of the world's largest economy and oil consumer.Brent crude had climbed 27 cents to $45.72 a barrel by 0426 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 24 cents at $43.40 a barrel, buoyed by a weaker dollar.Though rising in this session, Brent and WTI are on track for their biggest weekly losses since mid-January, hit by oil inventory builds and weak U.S. manufacturing data.Downward momentum is a feature of the oil market, said CMC Markets analyst Ric Spooner.The end of the U.S. driving season and the prospect of building inventories create downward risk for the oil price and may see further pressure on energy stocks today.Investors are looking ahead to non-farm payroll data later in the day for a sense of the direction of the U.S. economy, with a strong reading seen boosting the chance of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike soon.A rate rise may strengthen the U.S. dollar, which could depress oil prices as it would make the dollar-denominated commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies.Friday's oil price gains may be capped by concerns of slowing global economic growth. There is also growing scepticism among traders that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers such as Russia will agree to freeze production at a meeting in Algeria later this month.However, lending credence to a freeze, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, has appeared to change its stance and is likely to support production stabilization at the meeting.But further clouding the issue, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Friday played down the potential for talks on a possible output freeze.Additionally, more U.S. supply will return to the market as some producers in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico are restarting operations after Hurricane Hermine is set to make landfall.Manufacturing activities in parts of Asia, which accounts for most of the world's oil demand growth, has also slowed.Most of Asia depends on exports, and without demand picking up in the west and on the mainland (of China), it's hard to see a sustained rebound in trade, HSBC economist Frederick Neumann said in a note.",9/2/2016,279,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

311,Oil bet wrong rusting tankers rigs clog up Asian water,"JOHOR, MALAYSIA: Some 15 km (9 miles) from the bustling port of Singapore, a rusting tanker as big as the world's largest aircraft carriers lies idle in a muddy estuary flanked by mangrove trees on the coast of southern Malaysia.The 340-metre (1,115 ft) FPSO Opportunity, a hulking so-called Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel capable of drilling for oil in deep waters, is currently surplus to requirements along with scores of other rigs, tankers and support vessels in an era of cheap oil.The fleet of mothballed giant vessels anchored around Southeast Asian waters is the physical fallout of an oil downturn heading into its third year, and a stark reminder of how badly the industry miscalculated market conditions.There was a misguided focus? on scarcity in the supply side from the early 2000s, said David Fyfe, head of research at oil and commodity trading firm Gunvor.As an industry, they were complacent. They thought because cost was high, prices will remain high ... (but) then there was the advent of shale. Since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.The shale revolution turned the United States into one of the world's biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the Middle East and Russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices LCOc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.The FPSO Opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by Chevron CV.N and Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) before being taken over by a Bermuda-registered FPSO Opportunity Inc in 2011. The newest owner could not be reached for comment.NEW LANDSCAPEThe growing number of vessels anchored in the Johor river estuary is changing the landscape for the locals.I've been coming here to fish every day for 10 years, and never have there been more ships parked, said an angler named Aiman, sitting on an unused pipeline lying on the beach.It is quite intimidating to come here before dawn and to find, with the first rays of sun, another big ship has been parked here, he added, with his line dangling in the river.And it's not just Malaysia that has become the dumping ground for idled oil equipment.Across the Singapore Strait, in the bays of Indonesia's Batam island, over a hundred oil drilling and support vessels have been sitting idle for months, or even years.While laying up ships is legal and even provides profit to specialist mothballing companies, environmental groups say the growing number adds to the risk to flora and fauna.The idling oil tankers risk polluting the marine environment, which a sizable population of the riverine fishermen rely on for their living, said Vincent Chow, chairman of the Malaysian Nature Society in Johor, citing the threat of dissolving paint and potential leakage of heavy metals and fuel into the sea.COST OF DOING NOTHINGThe armada of laid-up vessels shows how the shale boom caught the oil industry off guard and scuppered plans to drill for new fields.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said global exploration spending halved in 2015, while BMI Research sees capital expenditure among oil producers suffering another sharp decline this year.Struggling drilling companies are paying to lay up rigs in the hope they will survive until demand picks up again.The cost depends on size and location, and whether they are in a so-called hot lay-up, whereby equipment is kept operational so the vessel quickly returns to service, or cold lay-up whereby ships can be mothballed for years.Cold lay-up for a rig or large oil tanker costs $20,000 to $25,000 a month in Johor, said Balasubramanian Krishna, operations manager at Malaysian lay-up specialist Ocean Shipcare, while laying-up a small supply vessel costs $3,000 to $4,000 a month.Matti Bargfried, head of marketing at maritime software company CODie, said a lay-up time of several years could make re-commissioning lengthy and costly.The main concern here is preservation against humidity, leakage of chemicals and condition of the hull, he said.This means that some of the idled vessels may have to be scrapped in yards in countries such as India or Bangladesh, although shippers say the current cost of the journey may be more than their scrap value.",9/22/2016,311,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

292,India WTO trade facilitation deal servi,"NEW DELHI: India will present proposals to the World Trade Organization on ways to ease trade in services, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday, as Asia's third-largest economy seeks to leverage one of its competitive strengths.India cleared the way for a WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement covering goods in 2014, after tortuous talks in which it won a concession letting it stockpile strategic food reserves for its mostly poor population of 1.3 billion people.New Delhi has often dragged its feet in the multilateral arena and been reluctant to cut bilateral free-trade deals because experience has shown its goods sector often cannot compete on international markets.By contrast, India's services sector, including back-office operations for multinationals, is a big export earner and the idea of striking a similar multilateral deal on services first came up at a meeting of trade ministers in Paris in June.While there seems to be trade facilitation for goods, there doesn't seem to be trade facilitation for services, and that was a point I made in Paris, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters at a business conference in New Delhi.This is a matter on which the WTO will now have to work, said Sitharaman, speaking on the sidelines of the Economist India Summit.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for freer trade in services at the recent Group of 20 summit hosted by China and, Sitharaman said, India will soon submit a paper to the WTO as requested at the Paris meeting.Modi told the G20 grouping that a knowledge and innovation-driven economy required free movement of professional workers.Restrictions on the admission of Indian IT experts have been one area of concern between the United States and India, and figured in recent two-way strategic and commercial talks. ",9/7/2016,292,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
294,Oil prices extend gains on weak dollar industry d,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose built on recent gains Thursday thanks to a softer dollar and industry data indicating US stockpiles sank last week.The gains extend a seven percent rally in the commodity since hitting Thursday´s two-week lows as investors look ahead to a Russia-OPEC meeting at the end of the month aimed at addressing an oversupply crisis.The latest bump came after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry-funded group, said US inventories fell 12.1 million barrels last week, according to Bloomberg News.Eyes are now on the release of official figures from the US energy department later Thursday, which will provide a better idea of the strength of demand in the world´s top economy and crude consumer.At about 0320 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery was up 81 cents, or 1.78 percent, to trade at $46.31 a barrel while Brent crude was up 76 cents, or 1.58 percent, to $48.74.Prices also got support from news that imports to China -- the world´s top energy consumer -- rose in August for the first time in 22 months, raising hopes the the huge economy is stabilising after years of slowing.Looking at the erratic price action recently, traders are obviously in a state of confusion. Whipsawed by OPEC comments, which run counter to the fundamental supply argument, said OANDA senior trader Stephen Innes in a note.Russia and OPEC are due to meet in Algeria later this week to discuss how to deal with a supply glut that has dragged down oil prices for the past two years.But traders are still sceptical on whether a deal can be reached after earlier efforts this year were scuppered by Iran who refused to agree to any deal as it emerged from years of nuclear-linked Western sanctions.",9/8/2016,294,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
295,Global airport traffic 64 percent 2015 fastest rate 2010,"MONTREAL: Global airport traffic grew at its fastest rate last year since 2010, rising 6.4 percent to 7.2 billion passengers, according to data published on Friday by an international trade association representing airports.But passenger growth this year could be tempered by the threat of militant attacks, geopolitical unrest and potential bottlenecks for passengers lining up to clear security checks, said the report by Montreal-headquartered Airports Council International, or ACI.It is important to maintain cautious optimism as we navigate through 2016, ACI World Director General Angela Gittens said in a news release. There are several impediments that could curtail the continued rise in demand, which could potentially encumber growth prospects over the short and medium terms.While the highest number of passengers, 2.46 billion, went through the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, up 8.6 percent from a year earlier, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson remained the world's busiest airport, the report said.Passenger traffic in emerging markets and developing economies soared 8.1 percent in 2015, compared with a 5.2 percent rise in slower-growing mature markets, said ACI, which collects data for over 2,300 airports in 160 countries.Passenger traffic generated by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa grew 8.2 percent on an annual basis.Globally, there were 37 large airports with over 40 million passengers, more than double the number in 2005.This level of growth is unprecedented, particularly since a majority of the airports in this category are from the typical mature markets of North America and Europe, the release said.It said North America experienced a resurgence in air transport demand, especially at many of its large hubs, following years of consolidation and capacity discipline by U.S. airlines. Large airports are benefiting from capacity shifts where flights are being directed through major connecting hubs.But the trend toward hubs comes at the expense of smaller regional airports, which are losing out on traffic, Gittens noted.Air cargo grew more weakly than passenger traffic, rising 2.6 percent in total volume during 2015, partly because of subdued growth in emerging markets and developing economies.",9/9/2016,295,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

300,Oil prices fall US drillers add rigs speculators cut long positi,"SINGAPORE: Crude prices fell over 1.5 percent on Monday after U.S. oil drillers added rigs to look for new production as producers adapt to cheaper crude, with speculators cutting positions betting on further price rises.Brent crude futures were trading at $47.29 per barrel at 0200 GMT, down 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 80 cents, or 1.74 percent, at $45.08 a barrel.Traders said the price falls on Monday and Friday were a result of increasing oil drilling activity in the United States, which indicated that producers can operate profitably around current levels.Each dollar is being used far more efficiently and, as a result, $50 oil appears much more palatable, Barclays bank said in a note to clients.U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a tenth week in the past 11, according to a Baker Hughes rig count report on Friday. It was the longest streak without rig cuts since 2011.Speculative oil traders also became less confident of higher oil prices, cutting their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions for a second consecutive week last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.Oil's near 5-percent price decline since Sept. 8 partly reverses a 10-percent rally early in the month, which was fuelled by speculation that oil exporters could cap production.Algeria's energy minister said there is a consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members about the need to stabilise the oil market to support prices, state news agency APS reported on Saturday.OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told APS that OPEC was not seeking a definite price range for oil but rather sustainable stability for the market.Moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilising crude output come five months after similar talks for a production freeze failed when Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran join the pact.Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilise the market, but has stopped short of committing to output restraint before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day, the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions which were lifted last January.Even if exporters agree on freezing output around current levels, analysts said that would do little to raise prices as most exporters are pumping out oil at or near record levels, and have adapted to do so at lower prices.Producers and service companies ... are well positioned to return to growth mode at much lower prices, Barclays said.",9/12/2016,300,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

The U.S. government will issue official inventory data on Wednesday.Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at $47.34 per barrel at 0103 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, from the last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures CLc1 were up 29 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $45.19 a barrel.Crude prices tumbled on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said slowing oil demand growth amid growing inventories and supplies could signal that the market will be oversupplied at least through the first half of 2017.Oil came under heavy selling after the EIA released its monthly report showing it expected the surplus in the market to persist well into 2017, Australian bank ANZ said in a note. Weaker oil prices are likely to weigh on the sector, with investor appetite remaining weak.Gains in crude prices could also be capped by rising crude exports from Libya after the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday it would immediately start working to resume crude exports from ports seized in recent days by forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.Libyan production could be raised to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 290,000 bpd within a month, further adding to the global crude supply glut.",9/14/2016,302,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

306,Fed again poised to cut longer run interest rate for,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK: U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output, productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades.It would be the fourth time in 15 months that the U.S. central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so-called neutral rate was too optimistic, raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years.The Fed, however, still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth.Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer-run rate at this week's monetary policy meeting, with the median forecast possibly falling to 2.75 percent. It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the shallowest set of rate hikes ever; much flatter, according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.They are not very far from being in a tightening mode, said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one, said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after. The Fed's rate-setting committee will meet again in early November and mid-December.",9/20/2016,306,business,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

317,Australia set to test twin spin attack against Windi,"SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Year´s test starting this weekend.An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australia´s victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner O´Keefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.O´Keefe´s inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.",1/1/2016,317,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
319,McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.“He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program,” McCullum said.“If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster,” added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.“He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended),” White said.“He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.“I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing,” added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",1/3/2016,319,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
320,England declare on 629 6 on record breaking day,"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow tore apart the South African bowling attack as they enjoyed a run feast at Newlands on a record-breaking second day of the second Test which led to England declaring their first innings on 629 for six.South Africa were 24 for one wicket in reply at tea with a 605-run deficit.Stokes amassed 258 runs and Bairstow an unbeaten 150 as they bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket Test record of 399 runs.Stokes notched up the quickest 250 (off 196 balls) in Test history after scoring the second fastest double century (163 balls) in a knock that lasted 198 deliveries, which included 30 fours and a England record 11 sixes.Bairstow notched an emotional first test century, with England declaring once he got to 150 off 191 balls with 18 fours and two sixes.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable one and half sessions of devastating batting before putting the dispirited-looking home side into bat.Stokes´ double century took 10 balls more than New Zealand´s Nathan Astle, who holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls. England´s previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwag´s record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africa´s horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

323,Amla makes century De Villiers falls for 88,"CAPE TOWN: Captain Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century on the third day of the second Test against England and AB de Villiers made 88 as South Africa reached tea on 290 for three on Monday.Amla scored his first hundred for more than a year and De Villiers reached 8,000 Test runs before he pulled a short ball from Steven Finn to James Anderson at mid-wicket just before the interval.South Africa trailed the touring side by 339 runs, 140 short of avoiding the follow-on, with Amla on 132 not out and Faf du Plessis on 15.Amla and De Villiers resumed on 141 for two and extended their partnership to 183, giving South Africa a foothold in the game after England declared on a massive total of 629 for six on a second day of record-breaking batting.The experienced pair played with much circumspection but did offer chances.<br/> Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.<br/> (Reuters) ",1/4/2016,323,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
324,Brathwaite cameo a bright spot in Sydney washou,"SYDNEY: Carlos Brathwaite shone briefly for West Indies but the rain was the only real winner on Monday as wet weather washed away all but 11.2 overs of play on the second day of the third Test against Australia.West Indies were 248 for seven in their first innings when the rain interrupted play for the third and final time half an hour after lunch in the wake of Brathwaite´s dismissal for 69.Play was officially abandoned at 4:35 p.m.(0535 GMT) as the rain continued to cascade down on Sydney Cricket Ground with the 14,266 optimistic souls who came through the gates despite the gloomy forecast offered a full refund.That meant that the flurry of boundaries with which Brathwaite lit up the few overs of action was ultimately a free show and the 27-year-old was warmly applauded for it by an appreciative crowd.Resuming on 35 with his team on 207 for six, the tall, muscular Bajan showed why he has been one of the few bright spots for West Indies on what has otherwise been a miserable tour.Playing his second Test after scoring 59 on debut in Melbourne last week, Brathwaite smashed four sixes and seven fours in his 71-ball innings.One of the two sixes he hit in one over off Australia paceman James Pattinson was a spectacular heave over the covers and deep into the crowd.A fuming Pattinson had his revenge, however, when he found his range and took out Brathwaite´s off stump with what the batsman described as a good nut.I was upset that once again I got a start and couldn´t carry on. One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize, Brathwaite said.Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said ´you know what, just enjoy the feeling´. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

To have them here in Cape Town is lovely and it is my mum’s birthday on the last day of the test so hopefully we can cap off a great game. “It was probably the best day of my life and one I will never forget.”After being recalled to the England side during last year’s Ashes triumph over Australia, Bairstow's place in the team has come under scrutiny. It has been a little while coming. There was a lot of talk here and there so I’m delighted to get over the line today,” he said.Stokes and Bairstow scored 399 in a record sixth-wicket stand as England declared on 629 for six on the second day of the second test at Newlands.It was a bludgeoning performance from Stokes, who scored a record-breaking 258 off 198 balls.It was an exhibition of stroke play, Bairstow said. We just clicked in and supported each other all the way through. To play a knock like that is something quite spectacular.“I’ve grown up with Stokesy and seen him play some fantastic knocks and to witness that today was extremely special and something a lot of people will never forget.” England will seek to take an even firmer hold on the test on Monday by quickly dismissing South Africa, who closed on 141 for two.It will be a strong move from us if we can come back in the morning and take some chances, Bairstow said. “Our bowlers have a wealth of experience in all different conditions and hopefully we can come out tomorrow, utilise a bit of reverse swing, moisture in the pitch and we go from there.",1/4/2016,326,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

350,Champion Federer sets up Raonic final in Brisb,"Defending champion Roger Federer will meet big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic in the final of the Brisbane International after the Swiss top seed dismantled rising Austrian talent Dominic Thiem 6-1 6-4 on Saturday.Federer left his opponent and the centre court crowd stunned as he charged to a 5-0 lead at the Pat Rafter Arena before encountering stiffer resistance from his 22-year-old opponent as the match progressed at the Australian Open warm-up.The youngest player in the top 20, Thiem shrugged off the first set horror show to unleash some exquisite backhand winners in the second that had the Swiss master nodding approval.Federer´s serve was bullet-proof during the clutch moments, however, and the world number three closed out the contest with a booming ace on his second match point.Federer, who will be contesting his third consecutive Brisbane final and is one victory away from an 89th ATP title, hailed his best match of the tournament.I really thought I hit the ball very well, the evergreen 34-year-old, lathered in sweat from the muggy Brisbane heat, said in a courtside interview.I´m very excited to be back in the final again. It´s a great start to the season and I´m very happy.Raonic earlier won a battle of big servers to down local contender Bernard Tomic 7-6(5) 7-6(5) in the first semi.Both players held their serve throughout the contest but it was the Canadian who took control in the tiebreaks, jumping out to early leads on each occasion.After Tomic won four straight points to make it 5-5 in the second set tiebreak, Raonic whipped a forehand winner down the line to bring up match point.He closed out the contest in style, lunging for a cross-court backhand volley to end Tomic´s solid run at the tournament, which included an upset win over world number eight Kei Nishikori.It was a great match today, a difficult one against Bernie. He´s been playing so well, I know he´s going to do great things this year, Raonic said.",1/9/2016,350,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

352,Bouchard heads to Melbourne Park with low expectati,"MELBOURNE: Former golden girl Eugenie Bouchard is heading into the Australian Open with zero expectations of success after a year plagued by injury and poor form.Following a breakout year in 2014, the Canadian tumbled out of the top 10 with first round exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.Worse was to come, with a dramatic locker room fall leaving her concussed and forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open, an incident which prompted the former world number five to sue the United States Tennis Association (USTA).After three months away from the tour, Bouchard made a positive return at Shenzhen last week, winning her first two matches before being beaten in the quarter-finals.She continues her preparations for the Australian Open at the Hobart International this week but was playing down her prospects of a return to winning ways in the immediate future.A month or two ago I wasn´t even sure I could play the Australian Open so I´m just so happy to be in Australia, looking forward to playing these two tournaments (with) zero expectations, the 21-year-old told reporters on Sunday.I´m feeling good. I didn´t want to play if I wasn´t somewhat prepared, so I worked really hard in the off season to try and catch up a bit.Returning at Shenzhen was a relief for the Canadian, whose run to the 2014 Wimbledon final and the Australian and French semi-finals in the same year saw her touted as a future world number one.To step on the court and play a full match with no pain, play three matches three days in a row, was a success for me even though I lost the last match, said Bouchard, now ranked 49th in the world after peaking at five in Oct. 2014.Bouchard will face American Bethanie Mattek-Sands in the first round in Hobart.

354,Record breakers Guptill Munro lead NZ,"AUCKLAND:  Colin Munro blasted New Zealand´s fastest Twenty20 half century to surpass a mark set by Martin Guptill earlier in the innings as the hosts swept their two-match series against Sri Lanka with a nine-wicket win in Auckland on Sunday.Guptill first rewrote the record books when he took just 19 deliveries to bring up his eighth half century in the shortest form of the game before he was eventually dismissed for 63 after smashing six boundaries and five sixes.His mark was then eclipsed by Munro some 20 minutes later when the left hander hit his seventh six to take New Zealand to 147 for one, the hosts chasing down Sri Lanka´s 142-8 total at Eden Park in just 10 overs.Munro´s half century came off 14 balls, the second fastest in international cricket behind India´s Yuvraj Singh (12 balls).He hit one four along with his seven maximums to finish unbeaten on exactly 50.The 2-0 series defeat also ensured Sri Lanka, the 2014 World Twenty20 champions, were replaced by West Indies at the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 rankings.Sri Lanka´s innings had been held together by Test and one-day captain Angelo Mathews´ 81 not out, his highest score in the format, while opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a streaky 28.No other batsmen got into double figures.As in most of the limited overs matches on the tour, Sri Lanka´s top order failed to get their innings going, slumping to 39-3 in the seventh over.Their normally reliable, and deep, middle order also failed to capitalise on Eden Park´s small boundaries as New Zealand´s bowlers varied their pace, line, length and flight, with part-time medium pacer Grant Elliott taking 4-22.The sixth Twenty20 World Cup takes place in India from March 8 to April 3.

MRI showed that I have just an inflammation and I can keep playing, so I will do my best and I will try to be there, to stay focused.The 24-year-old is one of four leading women players heading to the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on Monday, under an injury cloud.World number one Serena Williams (knee), fifth-ranked Maria Sharapova (arm) and number three Garbine Muguruza (foot) all withdrew from matches in the last week.Halep said before the clash with the 34th-ranked Garcia she was fit but she looked anything but during her medical time out after the Frenchwoman stepped up the aggression to take the second set.Halep, though, shrugged off the complaint to storm through the third set, reeling off five straight games and recording her first win of the year when Garcia netted a straightforward mid-court forehand.I needed matches to see if I can stay during the match until the end with my achilles, she said.I did well today. I´m happy that I could finish. I am happier that in the third set I didn´t feel the pain. It means that I can keep working and keep playing with tough opponents.

362,Lionel Messi wins Ballon dOr for fifth ti,"ZURICH: Lionel Messi reclaimed the FIFA Ballon d'Or award for the world player of the year on Monday from his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo who had walked off with the award for the previous two years.The Barcelona and Argentina forward took 41.33 percent of the votes followed by the Portuguese and Real Madrid forward (27.76 percent), with Brazil and Barcelona forward Neymar third (7.86 per cent).It is a very special moment for me to be back here on this stage, winning again another Ballon d’Or after being there in the audience watching Cristiano win, said Messi as he accepted the award at the end of a drawn-out 90-minute ceremony.It’s incredible this is my fifth.Barcelona's Luis Enrique was voted coach of the year while United States World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who scored a hat-trick in the final against Japan, was named women's player of the year.Initially started as the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1991, it became known as the Ballon d'Or after merging with France Football's European footballer of the year award in 2010.The award, shared exclusively between Messi and Real Madrid's Ronaldo since Brazilian Kaka won in 2007, has been heavily promoted by FIFA and was broadcast to 190 countries with 1,100 guests including players and coaches attending the ceremony.But it is not everyone's cup of tea and some critics, such as Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, say it is not appropriate in a team sport.I’m a big enemy of the Ballon d’Or. Who will win it? You know as well as I do that it’s certainly Messi who will win it. I think so. Overall I’m not a big fan of that, the Frenchman said earlier on Monday.The breakdown presented by FIFA also revealed tactical voting among the 165 national team coaches, 162 national team captains and 171 media representatives who cast votes.Messi, eligible to vote as Argentina captain, named Barcelona team mates Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta as his top three.Portugal captain Ronaldo choose three Real Madrid team mates -- Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.Belgium captain Vincent Kompany opted for his compatriots Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne as his top two.More surprisingly, Spain captain Iker Casillas -- the former Real Madrid goalkeeper who now plays for Portuguese club Porto -- was among those who did not vote.Despite a red carpet and plenty of glitz, the event had a low-key air of predictability about it and was held against the backdrop of FIFA going through the worst corruption crisis since it was founded in 1904.The sport is facing criminal investigations in both Switzerland and the United States, where some leading FIFA officials are among 41 individuals and sports entities who have been indicted on corruption charges.Outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter, normally a central figure in the ceremony, was not involved after being banned for eight years by the Ethics Committee in December and there was no President's Award, usually given out by Blatter for outstanding services to the game.Past recipients have included Pele, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the Haiti national team, Queen Rania of Jordan and South African anti-apartheid activist and veteran cleric, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.Acting president Issa Hayatou played a low-key role, reading a brief speech before the start and appearing on stage when the awards for best player and women's player were presented.Ronaldo said the players did not want to discuss FIFA's problems.We avoid answering this kind of question, he told a press conference before the ceremony.We are professional football players, we compete every week, every day, we train and we just focus on that. These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53.",1/12/2016,362,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

(0830 GMT) because Cricket South Africa could not book him on a flight earlier than 8 a.m. from Port Elizabeth, where he was due to play in a four-day provincial match.Flights from the coastal city to Johannesburg take two hours and the usual heavy traffic from the airport to the stadium looks set to add more drama to the dash.De Kock sustained a freak injury to his right knee on Wednesday.Quinton slipped and sprained his right knee at home late yesterday afternoon, South Africa manager Mohammed Moosajee said on Thursday.South Africa have also handed a debut to fast bowler Hardus Viljoen at the expense of spinner Dane Piedt.England, who won the first test by 241 runs in Durban, were unchanged despite several of the side recovering from a stomach virus that swept through the squad in Cape Town.em><Teams:</</emSouth Africa:Stiaan van Zyl, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers (captain), Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Dane Vilas (wicketkeeper), Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Hardus ViljoenEngland:Alastair Cook (captain), Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Joe Root, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wicketkeeper), Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James Anderson.",1/14/2016,366,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

He reviewed the umpire´s decision but technology showed a snick to the delight of home supporters after Root had dominated the second day with his unbeaten century.Moeen Ali (19) dispatched three lusty boundaries in a quick appearance at the wicket before edging a delivery from Chris Morris that saw wicketkeeper Dane Vilas pull off a stunning diving catch. Rabada then bowled Broad with a fullish delivery for 12 as England edged towards South Africa´s score.Steven Finn got the slightest touch off his gloves to a rising delivery from Morne Morkel and was caught behind without scoring.

Australia´s opening pair eventually fell in quick succession after identical knocks of 71, but Bailey added 78 runs with skipper Steven Smith (46) and George Maxwell (26 not out) hit the winning run to complete the chase with one over to spare.Bailey followed his 112 in Perth with a 58-ball knock that included six boundaries and a six.Melbourne hosts the third match on Sunday.

379,World tennis has been ripe for match fixing,"SYDNEY: Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders.Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the game´s authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne.Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove.Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis.If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, you´ll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins, he said.But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didn´t lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis.A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix.It´s a one-on-one sport and what you do is, you´re the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match.And you can never get caught, Georgakis added.Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites, and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually, Patrick Jay, an independent betting expert, told the United Nations in 2015.In that sea of money, tennis is the second most active betting market, trailing only soccer, research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows.Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs, a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity.Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point-by-point or game-by-game with limits on those types of bets, pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match.Say you want to throw a game but win the match, why would you bother? You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars, the gambler said.Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis.But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act.Most money is won by betting on the favourite, which is not a good result for bookmakers, he added.But if he´s up one set to love and then, in play, people start betting on the outsider…that would be us getting on the front foot, most likely, to say (to the authorities) ´is there anything you need for us to look into?´, the bookmaker said.",1/18/2016,379,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
380,Britains Konta downs Venus in Australian Open u,"MELBOURNE: Johanna Konta did not have to wait long after her stunning first round upset of Venus Williams at the Australian Open on Tuesday before having to field the inevitable questions about her national allegiance.Born and raised until her early teens in Sydney, the 24-year-old world number 47 moved to Britain in 2005 and plays under the flag of her adopted home.That background was not about to escape the attention of the local media, particularly after the impressive nature of her 6-4 6-2 win over the seven-times grand slam champion and former world number one.Asked whether she might consider switching her allegiance back to Australia, Konta was blunt. No, she said.Unfortunately, my home is Great Britain. It has been for a long time now, over a decade. Yeah, no, that´s where my heart is.Ah, jealousy is not a good thing, she grinned, as the questioner pursued the point by contrasting her victory with former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur´s first round exit.I think Australian tennis is doing quite well, to be honest.You have a number of very good players, and it´s -- what´s the word? It´s not a privilege, but it´s a compliment that you guys would say that, so thank you. But be grateful for what you guys have.Apart from the local verbal tick of beginning her answers with a yeah, no, Konta has gained more obvious benefits from her time in Australia.My ability to deal with the heat, she said. I think I´m very lucky that I got to spend a lot of my young years here, because I got obviously exposed to the heat out here.That was particularly beneficial on Tuesday when temperatures crept towards the 30 degrees Celsius mark on Rod Laver Arena.Because of her nationality switch, Konta is unlikely to be back on the main show court for her second round encounter with Carina Witthoeft or Zheng Saisai.

He also had another chance to get the title from a different organization with his fight against Keith Thruman last March and a close shave with Aaron Martinez in June.He was as lucky as whomever will win the Powerball jackpot when he was given a generous split decision against Aaron Martinez in June but even if you can stomach Guerrero in a world title fight the WBC clearly is violating its rules since it only ranks Guerrero sixth Rafael added.Meanwhile in case Garcia gets the win it will be the second time that he and Khan will fight against a title.Garcia who holds the record 31-0 with 18 knockout victories already fought with Khan for the junior welterweight title in 2012.",1/19/2016,381,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
382,Australia off spinner Hauritz announces retir,"MELBOURNE: Australia off-spinner Nathan Hauritz announced his retirement from competitive cricket on Tuesday, bringing the curtain down on a 15-year career during which he represented the national side in all three formats.Hauritz, one of the many spinners Australia turned to after the retirement of bowling great Shane Warne, did not have a state contract for the last two seasons and was used by his Big Bash League side Melbourne Renegades for one match this season.The 34-year-old failed to take a wicket in that clash, against Perth Scorchers, and conceded 29 runs in his two overs.I was just so shattered after the game, he told reporters. I realised I hadn´t come down here to be that disappointed about a game of cricket anymore. I thought ´I don´t need that anymore´. I just want to get away.The highs and lows (are too much). I need to get off that up-and-down rollercoaster and get back to a bit of normality in life.I competed as hard as I could but I just felt that me competing as hard as I could wasn´t good enough.Hauritz made his Australia debut in a one-day international against South Africa in 2002 before playing his first test against India in Mumbai two years later.He took 63 wickets in 17 Tests, the last of which he played against India in 2010. He has the same number of dismissals in 58 ODIs and also played three Twenty20 internationals for Australia.I have a lot of good memories, obviously a few bad ones mixed among them, Hauritz added. But I will definitely look back at my career very proud and very happy with what I achieved.” (Reuters) ",1/19/2016,382,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
384,FIFAs Blatter is still being paid his salary despite b,"FIFA's Sepp Blatter may have been banned for eight years from the game but he is still receiving his president's salary from world soccer's governing body, a spokesman for FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee told Reuters on Monday.Blatter was suspended for 90 days by FIFA on Oct 8 and then banned from the game for eight years last month for ethics violations over a $2 million payment FIFA made to European soccer boss Michel Platini with Blatter's approval in 2011.But Blatter, a Swiss national who has been president of FIFA since 1998, will continue to be paid until a new president is elected on Feb 26, the spokesman Andreas Bantel said. That would mean Blatter would have been paid for nearly five months during which time he was unable to carry out his duties, and a period in which FIFA has appointed an acting president, African soccer head Issa Hayatou.The compensation sub-committee of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee recently ruled that it could stop Blatter's bonuses but not, according to his contract, his salary.Until the election of a new president on February 26, Mr Blatter is the elected president and therefore - according to his contract - is entitled to receive his remuneration, Bantel said.Blatter's U.S. lawyer and his Switzerland-based spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.FIFA is facing the worst corruption crisis in it history as a total of 41 individuals and entities, including many former FIFA officials, have been charged with corruption-related offences in the United States. The U.S. investigation is far from over and FIFA also faces a parallel Swiss probe.Blatter's bonuses have been stopped because he was not carrying out his duties of supervising the organization, including its general secretary.Only last week, FIFA announced that Jerome Valcke was fired from his position as general secretary. It gave no reason but an investigation had followed allegations of corruption related to World Cup ticket sales.",1/19/2016,384,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
385,Bouchard suffers at hands of Radwanska after early promi,"MELBOURNE: Former golden girl Eugenie Bouchard´s hopes of rehabilitation at the Australian Open came to a swift end on Wednesday as wily Agnieszka Radwanska sent the Canadian spinning out of the tournament with a 6-4 6-2 defeat in the second round.The 21-year-old Bouchard, whose career hit the buffers last year following her break-out 2014 season when she reached the Wimbledon final, crumbled under the lights of Rod Laver Arena after sprinting into a 4-2 lead in the first set.She lost six straight games to gift the set and an early break in the second to the Polish fourth seed, and was then powerless to mount a challenge as her forehand misfired and the errors started piling up.Staring down the barrel at 5-2, Bouchard was presented with one last chance to rally, having prised three break-points as Radwanska served for the match.But the 37th-ranked Canadian squandered them all in a run of four unforced errors, capitulating meekly at the tournament that was the springboard for her sensational 2014.I definitely felt in control at that moment .You can´t ever back off her and give her a chance to breathe, Bouchard explained to reporters about her failure to capitalise on such an encouraging start in the night session match.Bouchard made the semi-finals at Melbourne Park and the French Open that year before going one better at Wimbledon, prompting pundits and former players to declare her a future grand slam champion.Reaching a peak of world number five, she made the Australian Open quarter-finals last year before the wheels fell off with first-round exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.A more promising run to the fourth round of the U. S. Open ended in drama when she slipped and fell on the locker room floor and had to withdraw from the tournament with concussion.She later sued the United States Tennis Association and was unable to complete a match for the rest of the year.Though speaking of new beginnings in Australia and bringing a new coach in former Maria Sharapova mentor Thomas Hogstedt, Bouchard appeared to arrive with other baggage.Her encouraging run to the final of the Hobart International was ended with a 6-1 6-2 meltdown against Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, and she complained of being distracted by personal family issues at home.However, she tried to remain upbeat after her loss to Radwanska.

Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout. In the next game, she was visibly crying in pain. At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts. ",1/25/2016,412,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

422,Serena beats Sharapova to reach semi fi,"MELBOURNE: Reigning champion Serena Williams ramped up the power in the second set to vanquish fifth seed Maria Sharapova for the 18th match in a row and reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open with a 6-4 6-1 victory on Tuesday.Sharapova broke the world number one in the first game and mounted a stiff challenge in the opening set but wilted in the second to extend a losing record that goes back 12 years.Williams said the Russian brings out the best in her.When I play her, I know automatically I have to step up my game, Williams said. I think that makes me play better. When I'm forced to play better, I do well.The gulf between Williams and Sharapova, a former number one and five-times grand slam champion, speaks volumes about the balance of power in the women's game.Williams has reached the last four at Melbourne Park on six previous occasions and gone on to win the title every time.On Tuesday's evidence, it looks like only illness or injury can prevent the 34-year-old from repeating the feat and adding a 22nd major title to her collection.The American, who came into the tournament after a four-month layoff, twice had treatment for food poisoning issues during breaks in the 92-minute rematch of last year's final.Sharapova handed back her early break with two double faults in game four but started the match well and offered a genuine test in the 55-minute opening stanza.The Russian showed character to storm back from 0-40 down to hold serve for 4-4 and was all over Williams's serve in the next game, the American yelling C'mon! on successive points as she finally held.The match turned on the next game when Sharapova fended off three set points despite failing to get her first serve in before Williams converted the fourth after a long rally with a volley at the net.Sharapova had fired 21 aces in her fourth round match but managed just seven against Williams.I think if you're serving maybe 180 (kph) against somebody else compared to Serena, that's an ace, said the 28-year-old.Against Serena, as we all know, the return is one of her great strengths. She's very explosive. She stays quite close to the baseline.She cuts the ball early. She doesn't give you many angles.Williams has an 8-0 record against her semi-final opponent Agnieszka Radwanska, who as the fourth seed is the highest ranked challenger remaining in the draw.Nothing's guaranteed in sports, said Williams. I still have to win two matches against potentially two extremely tough opponents.",1/26/2016,422,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

It blows my mind right now, Williams said in a courtside interview. I just feel like I'm being the best I can and I can't believe I'm in another final.She started really well in the second set and making some great shots and hitting it deep and I just thought that I had to be aggressive.Williams began in ominous fashion breaking the Pole's serve in the first game with Radwanska's lack of power highlighted by the blistering nature of the American's returns.Radwanska's fastest serve in the first game reached just 140 kph. Williams was returning the ball at over 130.The fourth seed appeared resigned to defeat in the first set by the fourth game. She barely got a backhand return to a Williams serve then stood, with slumping shoulders, and watched as the 34-year-old put the overhead smash away.Williams cleaned up the first set in just 20 minutes before Radwanska elicited the largest cheer of the match at that time when she held serve in the first game of the second set, avoiding an embarrassing potential 'double bagel' 6-0 6-0 score.The crowd on Rod Laver Arena, which had its roof closed due to heavy rain in Melbourne, however managed to almost open it in the sixth game with a decibel-rising roar of support for Radwanska when she broke Williams to level it at 3-3. Williams, however, broke again in the ninth game and then served out with three aces to seal a match in which she belted 42 winners to Radwanska's four.Radwanska, who had been bidding to reach her second grand slam final after Wimbledon in 2012, also heavily lost her only other semi-final appearance at Melbourne Park when she was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Dominika Cibulkova in 2014.",1/28/2016,426,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

437,Nearly 1 mn in FIFA funds missing in Gu,"GUATEMALA CITY: Nearly $1 million in funds from soccer's global governing body FIFA may have gone missing from Guatemala's soccer federation last year, according to sources and an internal audit seen by Reuters.Dozens of soccer officials worldwide have been charged by U.S. authorities probing corruption in FIFA, in an investigation that has sent shockwaves across the sport.In 2015, the Guatemalan soccer federation (Fedefut) received 8.24 million quetzals ($1.1 mln) in nine deposits from FIFA from February to October, according to a document signed by the federation's accountant and seen by Reuters.The Fedefut budget presented early last year totaled about $1.5 million but only included about $250,000 in FIFA funding while the remaining funds from the nine deposits were not included, according to sources knowledgeable about the internal audit.The internal audit was conducted by a FIFA committee put in charge of running the Guatemalan soccer federation following the arrest on corruption charges last month of top local officials, and earlier on Friday the committee filed a complaint over the missing funds with the attorney general's office of the Central American country.The federation's year-end spending report excluded the additional deposits.The membership of Fedefut's general assembly was also not informed of the nine deposits.That information was hidden, said one of the sources, adding that the results of an investigation into the missing funds will be provided to a visiting FIFA official next week.In one document, Fedefut's top budget official Oswaldo Rolando confirmed that the federation's financial division was informed of the extra deposits.I don't know why they weren't made available to the general assembly, Rolando said in the documents.Ciro Muralles, the former head of the financial division, said in a brief phone interview that he would not comment on the missing funds until he reviews the documents.A spokesperson for the FIFA committee running Guatemala's soccer federation confirmed that the complaint seeks an investigation into the crimes that might have occurred.Earlier this month, Guatemalan police arrested fugitive former Fedefut president Brayan Jimenez in connection with the corruption probe.Jimenez has been accused of taking bribes along with Hector Trujillo, former secretary general of the Guatemalan soccer federation, who was arrested last month in the United States.Both have denied the charges.",1/30/2016,437,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

Kohli, who smashed an unbeaten 90 in India´s 37-run win in Adelaide on Tuesday, hit seven boundaries and a six during his 33-ball knock.Australia, who made six changes in the side from their last defeat, also made a strong start with captain Aaron Finch providing the fireworks.Finch (74) and Shaun Marsh added 94 for the opening wicket to keep Australia, who handed T20 debuts to three players, in the hunt but India´s spinners picked up quick wickets to halt their march.Finch hit eight fours and two sixes in his 48-ball knock before he was run out trying to steal a quick single.India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni missed a regulation stumping off Marsh but made amends with smart work with the gloves to dismiss dangerman Glenn Maxwell for one off left-arm spinner Yuvraj Singh.Dhoni was also lucky when the ball ricocheted off his pads to hit the stumps with James Faulkner out of his crease, the dismissal snuffing out Australia´s hopes of levelling the series at 1-1.The hosts could only manage 157-8 in their 20 overs.Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah picked up two wickets each for India.The final match of the series will be played in Sydney on Sunday.

(Reuters) -Saturday´s match showcased his blossoming capabilities, with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation.Santner, who was joined by the right-handed Milne 12 runs later, however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm, turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary.Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, however, ended the partnership, and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300, to finish with 3-61 from 10 overs. ",2/6/2016,462,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end.

This is classified as a Specified Substance under World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List and is prohibited both in-competition and out-of-competition.Shah has emerged as a match-winner for Pakistan in Tests after ace spinner Saeed Ajmal lost form due to having to remodel an illegal bowling action.Shah admitted the violation and a three-month suspension has been imposed, backdated to 27 December 2015, the day when he was provisionally suspended. Shah will, therefore, be eligible to return to cricket on 27 March 2016.ICC said it accepted that the doping offence had been inadvertent on the part of Shah as the medication had been taken for therapeutic reasons, specifically to treat his blood pressure.He was able to satisfy the ICC through evidence and submissions prepared on his behalf by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he had no intention to enhance his sporting performance or to mask the use of another performance enhancing substance.He had, instead, mistakenly taken his wife’s blood pressure medication that was identical in appearance to his own but which contained the prohibited substance chlortalidone.The head of the Pakistan Cricket Board's medical panel, Sohail Salim, said he was satisfied with the ICC decision.We are happy that we made a genuine reply in Shah's case, Salim told AFP.At the time of Shah's suspension a lot of former cricketers, experts and doctors were giving their opinions without any knowledge and that was disturbing.Under anti-doping rules Shah could have been hit with a two to four year ban.",2/7/2016,472,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

West Indies' 300 for three, scored in 2004, is the record to date.In these days of great expectations of ODI scores, England's total of 318 for eight may not seem particularly extravagant. But on a cracked, two-paced pitch that challenges batsmen with uneven bounce, it is likely to prove a challenging target.South Africa lost the first two ODIs of the five-match series and are in danger of conceding defeat in the Test and ODI series to the same opposition during a home tour for the first time in 14 years.By the time South Africa struck for the fourth time, they could have been quietly satisfied with their work. Jos Buttler, again promoted to No. 4 to build upon the strong start from England's top order, had fallen first ball clipping to an intriguingly placed leg gully, while Eoin Morgan had laboured for 24 deliveries over his eight runs.But then Ben Stokes joined Root in a fifth-wicket stand of 82 in eight overs that took England's total from the average to the strong. ",2/9/2016,481,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,

486,Uncapped Dawson in England World T20 squad,"JOHANNESBURG: England have named uncapped Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson in their 15-man squad for the World Twenty20 to be staged in India next month, but there was no dramatic recall for Kevin Pietersen.Dawson, who turns 26 next month, has performed well with the England Lions side that recently played Pakistan A in the UAE and will link up later this week with the senior squad that is currently in South Africa.Liam Dawson has been selected after consistently strong performances for the Lions recently against Pakistan A. As a left-arm spinning all-rounder he will be a very useful addition particularly in sub-continent conditions, selector James Whitaker said in a media release on Wednesday.Pietersen´s form in recent domestic Twenty20 tournaments in South Africa and Australia had led to calls for his return to the side, though these were quickly snuffed out by captain Eoin Morgan this week.Fast bowler Steven Finn has been selected despite sitting out the limited overs portion of the South Africa tour with a side-strain. It means there is no place for the number one Test bowler Stuart Broad, who misses his first World Twenty20 tournament.England have also strengthened their management team with the return of former Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene for the first 10 days of the tournament.Ex-England Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood will also work alongside Trevor Bayliss, Paul Farbrace and Ottis Gibson for the duration of the event.England open their World Twenty20 campaign against West Indies on Mar.16 and will also play South Africa, Sri Lanka and a first round qualifier from Group B that includes Scotland, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.England were World Twenty20 champions in 2010 when they won the tournament staged in the West Indies.Squad: Eoin Morgan (captain), Moeen Ali, Sam Billings, Jos Buttler, Liam Dawson, Steven Finn, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, James Vince, David Willey.

490,Windies board rejects call for new deal in World T20 r,"KINGSTON: West Indies players will be thrown off the squad for the World Twenty20 if they do not agree to financial terms by Sunday´s deadline, the head of the region´s cricket board said on Tuesday.The hard-line stance comes in the wake of reports that the 15-man squad, upset at a huge pay cut, has rejected the contract offered by West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).Cricinfo.com on Tuesday published a letter from Darren Sammy to the WICB in which the West Indies captain said the financial terms for the World Twenty20, which starts in India on March 8, were unacceptable.We want to represent the West Indies but the financials on offer we can´t accept, Sammy wrote.WICB chief executive Michael Muirhead did not sound in a negotiating mood, however, when he spoke on Jamaican radio.The WICB is committed to play in the tournament, let me say that first, Muirhead said on Hitz 92fm.No one will leave the shores of the West Indies without signing a contract and if these players in particular choose not to sign, then I guess we´ll be left with no option but to substitute other players for them.Muirhead added that the board was not in a position to improve the renumeration package, negotiated with the players association nine months ago.They have had lots of time to digest and argue and do everything, he said.Five of the players were instrumental and were there at the onset, so at this point, I´m hoping that the players will sign and take advantage of the other benefits that are there.He said that players would receive half of any shirt sponsorship the board negotiates in addition to a portion of prize money.Although West Indies cricket has fallen on hard times in the test format, it remains a major player in the shortest form of the game.West Indies won the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka and are currently ranked second in the world.This year´s squad includes dashing batsmen Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard.Sammy, who requested an urgent meeting before Sunday´s deadline, has proposed the players participate in the World Twenty20 under the same conditions as at previous tournaments.He said players were facing a pay cut of nearly 80 percent and stood to earn only $21,000 apiece this year, compared to $135,000 at the last tournament.The latest impasse between WICB and the players comes some 18 months after the premature end of West Indies´ tour of India because of a longstanding payment dispute.",2/10/2016,490,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
491,De Kock Amla centuries help South Africa sink England,"PRETORIA: Centuries from openers Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla guided South Africa to a seven-wicket victory over England on Tuesday that kept alive their hopes of winning the five-match series of one-day internationals.Joe Root made a sparkling 125 as England, after winning the toss and electing to bat, piled up 318 for eight in 50 overs.De Kock (135) and Amla (127) then amassed 239 for the first wicket to lay the platform before South Africa reached the target with 22 balls to spare to cut their series deficit to 2-1.England, seeking to become the first touring team to win a test and ODI series in South Africa for 14 years, now bid to clinch overall victory in Johannesburg on Friday.De Kock, 23, was particularly brutal as he became the youngest player to record 10 ODI hundreds. He also made an unbeaten ton in the first game in Bloemfontein.Amla cut and pulled his way to a 22nd ODI century, and third in a row at Centurion Park.Earlier, Root eased to his seventh ODI century with a masterful display of power and placement, hitting 10 fours and five sixes.Root added 125 for the second wicket with opener Alex Hales (65) and 82 for the fifth with Ben Stokes (53) before being run out following a calamitous mix-up with the latter.Paceman Kyle Abbott took two for 50 and was the only South African bowler to keep his economy rate under six an over.",2/10/2016,491,sports,2024-06-22 08:26:41.377286+07,,
